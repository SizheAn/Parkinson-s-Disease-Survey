  Depression is a predominant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often under recognised and undertreated. To improve identification of depression in PD it is imperative to examine objective brain-related markers. The present study addresses this gap by using electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the processing of emotionally valanced words in PD.
  Methods
  Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed an affective priming task while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Prime and target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a short 250Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Depression was measured using an established rating scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether event-related potentials (ERP) varied as a function of depression scores.
  Results
  Key ERP findings reveal reduced responses in parietal midline P300, N400 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) difference waves between congruent and incongruent neutral targets in patients with higher depression scores.
  Limitations
  Comparisons of ERPs were limited by insufficient classification of participants with and without clinical depression. A majority of PD patients who had high depression scores were excluded from the analysis as they were receiving antidepressant and/or anxiolytic medications which could interfere with ERP sensitivity.
  Conclusions
  The present study suggests that the Pz-P300, N400 and LPP are ERP markers relates to emotional dysfunction in PD. These findings thus advance current knowledge regarding the neurophysiological markers of a common neuropsychiatric deficit in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Depression,BioPotential,,EEG,,j.jad.2018.11.094,Research Article,
Medication status and dual-tasking on turning strategies in Parkinson disease,"Adamson, M. B.; Gilmore, G.; Stratton, T. W.; Baktash, N.; Jog, M. S.",2019,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,"Parkinson disease, Gait, Turning strategies, Medication state, Dual-tasking, Movement disorders, Motor control","Background
  Parkinson disease (PD) patients have turning impairments that may increase fall risk. Clinics lack specialized kinematic equipment used in gait and turn analysis and require a simple method to evaluate fall risk and advise patients in turning strategy selection.
  Objectives
  To enhance understanding of PD turning strategies and determine if turning can be assessed using a video-recording and categorization method, we compared 180-degree and 90-degree turns as a function of medication status and dual-tasking (DT).
  Methods
  21 PD participants (H&Y stage 1--3) in PD-ON and PD-OFF medication states and 16 controls completed 180-degree and 90-degree turn-tasks with and without DT. Video-recordings of tasks permitted classification of 180-degree turns into Few-Step turns (FST) vs. Multi-Step turns (MST) and 90-degree turns into Step vs. Spin-turns. FST were further sub-classified into Twisting vs. Sideways turns and MST into Backward, Festination, Forward or Wheeling turns. Percentages of subtypes were analyzed across groups by task.
  Results
  IN 180-degree tasks, there was an effect of group: FST vs. MST F(2,55)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯9.578, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯<Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001. PD participants in the off-medication state (PD-OFF) produced significantly more MST with a larger number of different turning subtypes vs. controls or PD on medication (PD-ON). In 90-degree tasks, controls significantly increased their proportion of Step-turns while DT (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯<Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), an adaptation not observed in PD-ON or PD-OFF.
  Conclusions
  PD turning impairments may stem from an inability to select a unified turning strategy and to adapt to the turning environment, which may be exacerbated in PD-OFF.

  When older adults turn to sit, about 80% of the subjects complete the turn before starting to sit i.e., a distinct-strategy, while in about 20%, part of the turning and sitting take place concurrently, i.e., an overlapping-strategy. A prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlap interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) are related to worse motor symptoms and poorer cognition. In the present study, we evaluated what strategy is employed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) when they transition from turning to sitting.
  Methods
  96 participants with PD performed turn to sit as part of the Timed Up and Go test, both with and without medications, while wearing a body-fixed sensor. We quantified the turn-to-sit transition and determined which strategy (distinct or overlapping) was employed. We then stratified the cases and used regression models adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight to examine the associations of the D-interval or O-interval with parkinsonian features and cognition.
  Results
  Most patients (66%) employed the overlapping-strategy, both off and on anti-parkinsonian medications. Longer O-intervals were associated with longer duration of PD, more severe PD motor symptoms, a higher postural-instability-gait-disturbance (PIGD) score, and worse Freezing of gait. Longer D-intervals were not associated with disease duration or PD motor symptoms. Neither the D- nor O-intervals were related to cognitive function. Individuals who employed the overlapping-strategy had more severe postural instability (i.e., higher PIGD scores), as compared to those who used the distinct-strategy.
  Significance
  In contrast to older adults without PD, most patients with PD utilize the overlapping strategy. Poorer postural and gait control are associated with the strategy choice and with the duration of concurrent performance of turning and sitting. Additional work is needed to further explicate the mechanisms underlying these strategies and their clinical implications.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait,Balance",Wearable,,IMU,100,j.gaitpost.2018.10.018,Research Article,Also Predicting Response to Treatment

However, no work has analyzed in detail the importance of the different phonemes in the automatic detection of PD from the speech. This work proposes new approaches for this detection by using new classification schemes that allow to compare independently the different phonetic units of patients and controls employed during several speech tasks. Three different parkinsonian corpora were used allowing cross-validation and cross-corpora trials. The results of cross-validation trials (k-folds) provided accuracies between 81% and 94%, with AUC between 0.87 and 0.97 depending on the corpus, while cross-corpora trials yielded accuracies between 66% and 76% with AUC between 0.76 and 0.87. These results suggest that PD affects to the articulatory sequence as a whole, influencing more clearly phonetic units requiring a higher narrowing of the vocal tract. Additionally, text-dependent utterances are considered as the recommended speech task for the detection of PD in this type of schemes as these allow to compare more precisely the phonetic units of patients and controls. Lastly, this work discusses the existence of a glass ceiling in the accuracy of the systems for the automatic detection of PD using speech, concluding that this is below 95% for most of the cases.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.bspc.2018.10.020,Research Article,

As approximately 90% percent of PD patients exhibit some form of vocal disorders in the earlier stages of the disease, the recent PD telediagnosis studies focus on the detection of the vocal impairments from sustained vowel phonations or running speech of the subjects. In these studies, various speech signal processing algorithms have been used to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment, and the calculated features were fed to learning algorithms to construct reliable decision support systems. In this study, we apply, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to the voice signals of PD patients for feature extraction, which has higher frequency resolution than the classical discrete wavelet transform. We compare the effectiveness of TQWT with the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods used in diagnosis of PD from vocal disorders. For this purpose, we have collected the voice recordings of 252 subjects in the context of this study and extracted multiple feature subsets from the voice recordings. The feature subsets are fed to multiple classifiers and the predictions of the classifiers are combined with ensemble learning approaches. The results show that TQWT performs better or comparable to the state-of-the-art speech signal processing techniques used in PD classification. We also find that Mel-frequency cepstral and the tunable-Q wavelet coefficients, which give the highest accuracies, contain complementary information in PD classification problem resulting in an improved system when combined using a filter feature selection technique.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.asoc.2018.10.022,Research Article,

  Cortical dysfunctioning significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).
  Objective
  We aimed at testing whether an acute levodopa administration has measurable and specific cortical effects possibly related to striatal dopaminergic deficit.
  Methods
  In thirteen PD patients, we measured the electroencephalographic responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS/EEG) of the supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobule (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8) before and after an acute intake of levodopa. We also performed a single-photon emission computed tomography and [123I]N-Ãâ€°-fluoropropyl-2ÃŽÂ²-carbomethoxy-3ÃŽÂ²-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane to identify the more affected and the less affected brain side in each patient, according to the dopaminergic innervation loss of the putamen. Cortical excitability changes before and after an acute intake of levodopa were computed and compared between the more and the less affected brain side at the single-patient as well as at the group level.
  Results
  We found that levodopa intake induces a significant increase (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯<Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01) of cortical excitability nearby the supplementary motor area in the more affected brain side, greater (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯<Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.025) than in the less affected brain side. Notably, cortical excitability changes nearby the superior parietal lobule were not statistically significant.

Gait signal is one of the best features to characterize and detect movement disorders caused by a malfunction in parts of the brain and nervous system of the patients with PD. Various classification approaches using spatiotemporal gait variables have been presented earlier to classify Parkinson's gait. In this study we propose a novel method for gait pattern classification between patients with PD and healthy controls, based upon phase space reconstruction (PSR), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and neural networks. First, vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs) at specific positions of human feet are captured and then phase space is reconstructed. The properties associated with the gait system dynamics are preserved in the reconstructed phase space. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been used. These measured parameters demonstrate significant difference in gait dynamics between the two groups and have been utilized to form a reference variable set. Second, reference variables are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and the third IMFs are extracted and served as gait features. Third, neural networks are then used as the classifier to distinguish between patients with PD and healthy controls based on the difference of gait dynamics preserved in the gait features between the two groups. Finally, experiments are carried out on 93 PD patients and 73 healthy subjects to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using 2-fold, 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation styles, the correct classification rates are reported to be 91.46%, 96.99% and 98.80%, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic and non-invasive classification between patients with PD and healthy subjects.",>30,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,Force sensor,uk,j.neunet.2018.12.012,Research Article,

  Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders that affect neurons in the brain resulting in a debilitating condition and progressive degeneration of nerve cells. These diseases involve different aspects among which speech impairment. Vocal signal analysis is used to evaluate this impairment and to discriminate normal from pathological voices.
  Materials and methods
  In this paper, two methods of vocal signal analysis have been proposed to evaluate an anomalous condition in human speech, known as dysarthria, useful to compare pathological and healthy voices. Parkinson and Multiple Sclerosis disease have been considered and patients affected by both pathologies have been enrolled. The methods have been tested on 153 voice signals belonging to: 39 healthy subjects (HS), 60 patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and 54 patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Acoustic (F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR) and vowel metric (tVSA, qVSA, FCR) features have been extracted.
  Results
  The results report significant differences in almost all of these features in pathological and healthy voices by performing statistical tests. F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR, tVSA and FCR are statistically significant features thus they can be used as indicators in the diagnosis of dysarthria-related diseases such as in PD and MS. The results suggest that the applied methodologies are efficient and useful in characterizing the different behavior of vocal signal in healthy and pathological subjects. Consequently, they could be a valid support for physicians in disease evaluation and progression monitoring.
  Conclusions
  The contribution aims to evaluate, support and diagnose the comorbidity in pathological patients verifying the co-occurrence of speech and neurological disorders in the same individual. The proposed solution is studied and implemented to be efficient and low cost following the model of precision medicine to customize clinical practice in disease diagnosis and treatment.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.ijmedinf.2018.11.008,Research Article,Also Prognosis/Monitoring of Disease

One of the main motor characteristics of PD is the hand tremor faced by patients, which turns out to be a crucial information to be used towards a computer-aided diagnosis. In this context, we make use of handwriting dynamics data acquired from individuals when submitted to some tasks that measure abilities related to writing skills. This work proposes the application of recurrence plots to map the signals onto the image domain, which are further used to feed a Convolutional Neural Network for learning proper information that can help the automatic identification of PD.

  A style of dance called tango translates clinical practice into a new philosophy and rehabilitative approach for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). The style of dance mixes music, self-generated and external cued strategies and social and emotional recovery.

Pathological attenuation of the right prefrontal cortex activity predicts speech and limb motor timing disorder in Parkinson's disease,"Behroozmand, Roozbeh; Johari, Karim",2019,Behavioural Brain Research,"Parkinson's disease, Speech production, Limb movement, Movement disorder, Reaction time, Event-related potentials","Neurological deficits can cause a wide range of motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, our understanding about the effects of PD on the underlying neural mechanisms of motor function has remained elusive. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between PD pathology and neurological deficits in planning and execution mechanisms of motor timing during speech production and limb movement. We used a combination of behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures to characterize motor timing deficits in patients with PD compared with a neurologically intact matched control group during randomized speech vowel vocalization and button press motor reaction time tasks in response to temporally predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli. Behavioral results indicated slower motor reaction times in PD regardless of motor modality or temporal predictability of sensory stimuli. In addition, our analysis indicated that slower motor reaction times in PD were correlated with pathological attenuation of neural activities within the right precentral and inferior frontal cortex only before the onset of speech production and limb movement. These findings highlight the role of a right-lateralized prefrontal cortical network in motor planning and its relationship with PD pathology during speech and limb movement timing control. Based on these data, we suggest that pathological attenuation of neural activities within this network is a neurophysiological biomarker of general and modality non-specific motor timing deficits in PD. We propose that this right-lateralized prefrontal network is a potential candidate for targeted treatment of speech and limb motor timing disorders in patients with PD.",,,Rehabilitation,speech and limb motor timing,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

The aim of this pilot study was to examine PFC activity during turning in PD and healthy controls, and to investigate the association between PFC activity and turning. Thirty-two subjects, 15 freezers (PD + FoG) and 17 non-freezers (PD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™ FoG), and 8 controls were asked to perform a 2-min turning-in-place test under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions.

  Turning is impaired in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and it is a common trigger for Freezing of gait (FoG). Recent evidence suggests that people with PD who freeze (PD+FoG) have worse turning performance than those who don't have freezing (non-freezers, PD-FoG), and the freezing episodes are exacerbated by increasing the turn angular amplitude.

Quantitative measures of turning and the dual-task cost were computed. Differences were investigated between groups and within turning types using ANOVA. Associations between turn measures and clinical scales were examined with Spearman correlations.

  Clinical assessment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is subjective and may not reflect patient real-world experience. This two-part pilot study evaluated the accuracy of the NIMBLE wearable biosensor patch (containing an accelerometer and electromyography sensor) to record body movements in clinic and home environments versus clinical measurement of motor symptoms.
  Methods
  Patients (Hoehn & Yahr 2-3) had motor symptom fluctuations and were on a stable levodopa dose. Part 1 investigated different sensor body locations (six patients). In Part 2, 21 patients wore four sensors (chest, and most affected side of shin, forearm and back-of-hand) during a 2-day clinic- and 1-day home-based evaluation. Patients underwent Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale assessments on days 1-2, and performed pre-defined motor activities at home on day 3. An algorithm estimated motor-symptom severity (predicted scores) using patch data (in-clinic); this was compared with in-clinic motor symptom assessments (observed scores).
  Results
  The overall correlation coefficient between in-clinic observed and sensor algorithm-predicted scores was 0.471 (p = 0.031). Predicted and observed scores were identical 45% of the time, with a predicted score within a Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±1 range 91% of the time. Exact accuracy for each activity varied, ranging from 32% (pronation/supination) to 67% (rest-tremor-amplitude). Patients rated the patch easy-to-use and as providing valuable data for managing PD symptoms. Overall patch-adhesion success was 97.2%. The patch was safe and generally well tolerated.
  Conclusions
  This study showed a correlation between sensor algorithm-predicted and clinician-observed motor-symptom scores.

Behavioral therapies, such as rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), have been developed more recently and demonstrated efficacy. However, the neural mechanisms of RAS are only vaguely understood. In this study, we examined the neurophysiology of RAS using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a sample of older adults with (21 people) and without PD (23 participants). All participants underwent high-density MEG during a beat-based cued tapping task with rhythmic and non-rhythmic patterns, and the resulting data were analyzed using a Bayesian image reconstruction method. Complex wavelet based time-frequency decomposition was used to compute inter-trial phase locking factor (PLF) to auditory stimuli for left and right signal space projection vectors. Tapping with a rhythm compared to a non-rhythmic sequence resulted in differential brain activity in each group: (i) a greater activation of temporal, motor and parietal areas was found in healthy adults; (ii) a greater reliance on parietal and frontal gyri was found in PD participants. During rhythmic tapping, older adults without PD had significantly stronger neural activity in bilateral frontal, supplementary and primary motor areas compared to those with PD. Conversely, older adults with PD exhibited significantly stronger activity in the bilateral parietal regions, as well as the rolandic operculum and bilateral supramarginal gyri, relative to their healthy peers. These data suggest that RAS mobilizes diverse oscillatory networks; Healthy controls may shift to frontal areas mobilization whereas PD patients rely on parietal areas to a greater extent, which may reflect frontal network dysfunction with compensation in PD, and could serve as specific regions of interest for further RAS studies.",,,Rehabilitation,Motor symptoms,BioPotential,,MEG,,,,
Upper body accelerations as a biomarker of gait impairment in the early stages of Parkinson's disease,"Buckley, Christopher; Galna, Brook; Rochester, Lynn; MazzÃƒÆ’Ã‚ , Claudia",2019,Gait & Posture,"Gait analysis, Accelerometers, Harmonic ratio, Balance, Head and pelvis, Human movement","Background
  Changes in upper body (UB) motion during gait may be a marker of incipient pathology, intervention response and disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD), which if independent from the lower body motion, might provide an improved assessment of gait.
  Research question
  This study aimed to test this hypothesis and establish whether variables calculated from accelerations measured on the UB are unique from spatiotemporal characteristics and can contribute to an improved classification of PD gait.
  Methods
  Data was obtained from 70 people with PD (69.2 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 9.9 y.o., UPDRS III: 36.9 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 12.3) and 64 age-matched controls (71.6 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 6.8 y.o.). Spatiotemporal characteristics were measured using a pressure sensitive mat (GAITRite). Head and pelvis accelerations were synchronously measured with wearable inertial sensors (Opal, APDM). Pearson's product-moment correlations were calculated between 49 selected variables from UB accelerations (representing magnitude, smoothness, regularity, symmetry and attenuation) and 16 traditional spatiotemporal characteristics (representing pace, variability, rhythm, asymmetry and postural control). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to test the variables ability to classify PD gait.
  Results
  The variables were mostly unique from each other (67% of variables recorded an r < 0.3). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that UB variables were moderately better at classifying PD gait than the spatiotemporal characteristics (Univariate: 0.70 to 0.81, Multivariate: 0.88 to 0.91 AUC).
  Significance

Kalpa Latha",2019,Measurement,"CELM, Cognitive Rule Engine, Facial expressions, Intelligent, Diagnosis","In today's world, every human's life is affected by the several numbers of diseases which increases day-by-day due to the unpredicted growth of the pathogens. This leads to the increase in the death rate of the humans in which 70% take place without the proper knowledge of the diagnosis of diseases and care-taking mechanism. Numerous methods have been proposed for the diagnosis of the diseases or predetermination of the diseases. We propose a new method for diagnosing the disease through the fusion of bio-signal and the facial expression codes. The new algorithm which is based on the Cognitive Extreme Learning Machines (CELM) has been implemented for the classification of different facial expressions in accordance with the symptoms of the diseases and relates the results for their diagnosis.

Upper limb motor pre-clinical assessment in Parkinson's disease using machine learning,"Cavallo, Filippo; Moschetti, Alessandra; Esposito, Dario; Maremmani, Carlo; Rovini, Erika",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Decision support systems, Idiopathic hyposmia, Inertial wearable sensors, Machine learning, Motor pre-clinical symptoms, Prodromal phase, Parkinson's disease","Introduction
  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by disabling motor and non-motor symptoms. For example, idiopathic hyposmia (IH), which is a reduced olfactory sensitivity, is typical in >95% of PD patients and is a preclinical marker for the pathology.
  Methods
  In this work, a wearable inertial device, named SensHand V1, was used to acquire motion data from the upper limbs during the performance of six tasks selected by MDS-UPDRS III. Three groups of people were enrolled, including 30 healthy subjects, 30 IH people, and 30 PD patients. Forty-eight parameters per side were computed by spatiotemporal and frequency data analysis. A feature array was selected as the most significant to discriminate among the different classes both in two-group and three-group classification. Multiple analyses were performed comparing three supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes, on three different datasets.
  Results
  Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (F-Measure 0.95 for RF and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including subjects with hyposmia as a separate group (0.79 accuracy, 0.80 precision with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, RF classifiers were the best approach for this application.
  Conclusion
  The system is suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis. Further, combining motion analysis with a validated olfactory screening test, a two-step non-invasive, low-cost procedure can be defined to appropriately analyze people at risk for PD development, helping clinicians to identify also subtle changes in motor performance that characterize PD onset.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Wearable,,IMU,,,,
Phase lag index and spectral power as QEEG features for identification of patients with mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,"Chaturvedi, Menorca; Bogaarts, Jan Guy; (Cozac), Vitalii V. Kozak; Hatz, Florian; Gschwandtner, Ute; Meyer, Antonia; Fuhr, Peter; Roth, Volker",2019,Clinical Neurophysiology,"Parkinson's disease, QEEG, Connectivity, Spectral power, Mild cognitive impairment, Machine learning","Objectives
  To identify quantitative EEG frequency and connectivity features (Phase Lag Index) characteristic of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and to investigate if these features correlate with cognitive measures of the patients.
  Methods
  We recorded EEG data for a group of PD patients with MCI (n = 27) and PD patients without cognitive impairment (n = 43) using a high-resolution recording system. The EEG files were processed and 66 frequency along with 330 connectivity (phase lag index, PLI) measures were calculated. These measures were used to classify MCI vs. MCI-free patients. We also assessed correlations of these features with cognitive tests based on comprehensive scores (domains).
  Results
  PLI measures classified PD-MCI from non-MCI patients better than frequency measures. PLI in delta, theta band had highest importance for identifying patients with MCI. Amongst cognitive domains, we identified the most significant correlations between Memory and Theta PLI, Attention and Beta PLI.
  Conclusion
  PLI is an effective quantitative EEG measure to identify PD patients with MCI.
  Significance
  We identified quantitative EEG measures which are important for early identification of cognitive decline in PD.",20<n<=30,Laboratory,Diagnosis,Cognitive activity,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,
Physiological complexity of gait between regular and non-exercisers with Parkinson's disease,"Combs-Miller, Stephanie A.; Dugan, Eric L.; Beachy, Ann; Derby, Brook B.; Hosinski, Alicia L.; Robbins, Kristen",2019,Clinical Biomechanics,"Entropy, Exercise, Boxing, Antiparkinson agents, Parkinson's disease","Background
  Physiological complexity represents overall health of a system and its underlying capacity to adapt to stresses. The primary purpose of this study was to determine if physiological complexity of gait both ON and OFF anti-Parkinson medication differed between regular and non-exercisers with Parkinson's disease.
  Methods
  Twenty participants with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were enrolled in this cross-sectional study (regular exercisers n = 10, non-exercisers n = 10). Two data collection sessions were completed during a single visit, first after a 12-hour overnight withdrawal from anti-Parkinson medications (OFF), and again one-hour after taking anti-Parkinson medications (ON). During each session participants completed a 2-minute walking task at their preferred pace while wearing wireless inertial measurement units on each lower extremity segment (thigh, shank, foot). Multivariate multiscale entropy was calculated from the tri-axial accelerometer signals and converted to a complexity index for analysis.
  Findings
  Regular exercisers demonstrated significantly higher complexity indices ON and OFF anti-Parkinson medications compared to non-exercisers (ON F = 3.84 P = 0.02; OFF F = 3.61, P < 0.03). Regular exercisers did not significantly differ in complexity between OFF and ON states (most affected leg F = 0.15 P = 0.71; least affected leg F = 0.30 P = 0.60), but non-exercisers demonstrated significantly decreased complexity in the least affected leg OFF anti-Parkinson medications (F = 5.17 P < 0.04).
  Interpretation
  Enhanced gait complexity in the regular exercisers may indicate that ongoing exercise is a key ingredient contributing to health in persons with Parkinson's disease. Exercising on a regular basis with Parkinson's disease may augment one's ability to adapt to barriers encountered during gait regardless of medication state.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait,Wearable,,IMU,,,,
Aberrant resting-state oscillatory brain activity in Parkinson's disease patients with visual hallucinations: An MEG source-space study,"Dauwan, M.; Hoff, J. I.; Vriens, E. M.; Hillebrand, A.; Stam, C. J.; Sommer, I. E.",2019,NeuroImage: Clinical,"MEG, Visual hallucinations, Multimodal hallucinations, Cholinergic dysfunction, Parkinson's disease","To gain insight into possible underlying mechanism(s) of visual hallucinations (VH) in Parkinson's disease (PD), we explored changes in local oscillatory activity in different frequency bands with source-space magnetoencephalography (MEG). Eyes-closed resting-state MEG recordings were obtained from 20 PD patients with hallucinations (Hall+) and 20 PD patients without hallucinations (Hall-), matched for age, gender and disease severity. The Hall+ group was subdivided into 10 patients with VH only (unimodal Hall+) and 10 patients with multimodal hallucinations (multimodal Hall+). Subsequently, neuronal activity at source-level was reconstructed using an atlas-based beamforming approach resulting in source-space time series for 78 cortical and 12 subcortical regions of interest in the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. Peak frequency (PF) and relative power in six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta and gamma) were compared between Hall+ and Hall-, unimodal Hall+ and Hall-, multimodal Hall+ and Hall-, and unimodal Hall+ and multimodal Hall+ patients. PF and relative power per frequency band did not differ between Hall+ and Hall-, and multimodal Hall+ and Hall- patients. Compared to the Hall- group, unimodal Hall+ patients showed significantly higher relative power in the theta band (p = 0.005), and significantly lower relative power in the beta (p = 0.029) and gamma (p = 0.007) band, and lower PF (p = 0.011). Compared to the unimodal Hall+, multimodal Hall+ showed significantly higher PF (p = 0.007). In conclusion, a subset of PD patients with only VH showed slowing of MEG-based resting-state brain activity with an increase in theta activity, and a concomitant decrease in beta and gamma activity, which could indicate central cholinergic dysfunction as underlying mechanism of VH in PD. This signature was absent in PD patients with multimodal hallucinations.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,EEG abnormalities,BioPotential,,MEG,,,,
Personalized transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and physical therapy to treat motor and cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease: A randomized cross-over trial,"Felice, Alessandra Del; Castiglia, Leonora; Formaggio, Emanuela; Cattelan, Manuela; Scarpa, Bruno; Manganotti, Paolo; Tenconi, Elena; Masiero, Stefano",2019,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Neurotherapeutic target, Electroencephalography, Neurophysiology, Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS III), Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)","Abnormal cortical oscillations are markers of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can modulate brain oscillations and possibly impact on behaviour. Mapping of cortical activity (prevalent oscillatory frequency and topographic scalp distribution) may provide a personalized neurotherapeutic target and guide non-invasive brain stimulation. This is a cross-over, double blinded, randomized trial. Electroencephalogram (EEG) from participants with PD referred to Specialist Clinic, University Hospital, were recorded. TACS frequency and electrode position were individually defined based on statistical comparison of EEG power spectra maps with normative data from our laboratory. Stimulation frequency was set according to the EEG band displaying higher power spectra (with beta excess on EEG map, tACS was set at 4 Hz; with theta excess, tACS was set at 30 Hz). Participants were randomized to tACS or random noise stimulation (RNS), 5 days/week for 2-weeks followed by ad hoc physical therapy. EEG, motor (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor: UPDRS III), neuropsychological (frontal, executive and memory tests) performance and mood were measured before (T0), after (T1) and 4-weeks after treatment (T2). A linear model with random effects and Wilcoxon test were used to detect differences. Main results include a reduction of beta rhythm in theta-tACS vs. RNS group at T1 over right sensorimotor area (p = .014) and left parietal area (p = .010) and at T2 over right sensorimotor area (p = .004) and left frontal area (p = .039). Bradykinesia items improved at T1 (p = .002) and T2 (p = .047) compared to T0 in the tACS group. In the tACS group the MontrÃƒÂ©al Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) improved at T2 compared with T1 (p = .049). Individualized tACS in PD improves motor and cognitive performance.

These systems have the potential to assist the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease (PD). Handwriting plays a special role in the context of PD assessment. In this paper, the discriminating power of ""dynamically enhanced""Ã‚Â static images of handwriting is investigated. The enhanced images are synthetically generated by exploiting simultaneously the static and dynamic properties of handwriting. Specifically, we propose a static representation that embeds dynamic information based on: (i) drawing the points of the samples, instead of linking them, so as to retain temporal/velocity information; and (ii) adding pen-ups for the same purpose. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new handwriting representation, a fair comparison between this approach and state-of-the-art methods based on static and dynamic handwriting is conducted on the same dataset, i.e. PaHaW. The classification workflow employs transfer learning to extract meaningful features from multiple representations of the input data. An ensemble of different classifiers is used to achieve the final predictions. Dynamically enhanced static handwriting is able to outperform the results obtained by using static and dynamic handwriting separately.",,,Diagnosis,Handwriting,Images,,Camera,,,,
Gait stride-to-stride variability and foot clearance pattern analysis in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease and Vascular Parkinsonism,"Ferreira, Flora; Gago, Miguel F.; Bicho, Estela; Carvalho, Catarina; Mollaei, Nafiseh; Rodrigues, Lurdes; Sousa, Nuno; Rodrigues, Pedro Pereira; Ferreira, Carlos; Gama, JoÃƒÂ£o",2019,Journal of Biomechanics,"Vascular Parkinsonism, Idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Toe and heel clearance, Short and long-term gait variability, Levodopa","The literature on gait analysis in Vascular Parkinsonism (VaP), addressing issues such as variability, foot clearance patterns, and the effect of levodopa, is scarce. This study investigates whether spatiotemporal, foot clearance and stride-to-stride variability analysis can discriminate VaP, and responsiveness to levodopa. Fifteen healthy subjects, 15 Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) patients and 15 VaP patients, were assessed in two phases: before (Off-state), and one hour after (On-state) the acute administration of a suprathreshold (1.5 times the usual) levodopa dose. Participants were asked to walk a 30-meter continuous course at a self-selected walking speed while wearing foot-worn inertial sensors. For each gait variable, mean, coefficient of variation (CV), and standard deviations SD1 and SD2 obtained by PoincarÃƒÂ© analysis were calculated. General linear models (GLMs) were used to identify group differences. Patients were subject to neuropsychological evaluation (MoCA test) and Brain MRI. VaP patients presented lower mean stride velocity, stride length, lift-off and strike angle, and height of maximum toe (later swing) (p < .05), and higher %gait cycle in double support, with only the latter unresponsive to levodopa. VaP patients also presented higher CV, significantly reduced after levodopa. Yet, all VaP versus IPD differences lost significance when accounting for mean stride length as a covariate. In conclusion, VaP patients presented a unique gait with reduced degrees of foot clearance, probably correlated to vascular lesioning in dopaminergic/non-dopaminergic cortical and subcortical non-dopaminergic networks, still amenable to benefit from levodopa.

We recorded scalp EEG and basal ganglia local field potentials in Parkinson's disease patients (11 STN, 7 GPi) ON and OFF dopaminergic medication while they performed a visually-guided force matching task using a pen on a force-sensitive graphics tablet. Force adjustments were accompanied by beta power suppression irrespective of whether the force was increased or reduced. Before the adjustment was completed, beta activity returned. High beta power was specifically associated with slowing of the force adjustment. ON medication, the peak force rate was faster and cortico-basal ganglia beta phase coupling was more readily modulated. In particular, phase decoupling was stronger during faster adjustments. The results suggest that beta power in the basal ganglia does not covary with force per se, but rather with a related factor, the absolute force rate, or a more general concept of movement effort. The results also highlight that beta activity reappears during stabilization of isometric contractions, and that dopamine-related suppression of cortico-basal ganglia beta coupling is linked to faster force adjustments.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,EEG abnormalities,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

  To investigate differences in surface electromyography (EMG) features in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and aged-matched controls.
  Methods
  Surface EMG was recorded during isometric leg extension in PD patients prior to, and after undergoing a locomotor training programme, and in aged-matched controls. Differences in EMG structure were quantified using determinism (%DET), sample entropy (SampEn) and intermuscular coherence.
  Results
  %DET was significantly higher, and SampEn significantly lower, in PD patients. Intermuscular coherence was also significantly higher in the PD group in theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. %DET increased and SampEn decreased with increasing Movement-Disorder-Society UPDRS scores, while theta band coherence was significantly correlated with total MDS-UPDRS scores and torque variance. Neither %DET, SampEn nor intermuscular coherence changed in response to training.
  Conclusions
  The differences observed are consistent with increased synchrony among motor units within and across leg muscles in PD. Differences between EMG signals recorded from the PD and control groups persisted post-therapy, after improvements in walking capacity occurred.

  Recent work suggests that wearables can augment conventional measures of Parkinson's disease (PD). We evaluated the relationship between conventional measures of disease and motor severity (e.g., MDS-UPDRS part III), laboratory-based measures of gait and balance, and daily-living physical activity measures in patients with PD.
  Methods
  Data from 125 patients (age: 71.7 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 6.5 years, Hoehn and Yahr: 1-3, 60.5% men) were analyzed. The MDS-UPDRS-part III was used as the gold standard of motor symptom severity. Gait and balance were quantified in the laboratory. Daily-living gait and physical activity metrics were extracted from an accelerometer worn on the lower back for 7 days.
  Results
  In multivariate analyses, daily-living physical activity and gait metrics, laboratory-based balance, demographics and subject characteristics together explained 46% of the variance in MDS-UPDRS-part III scores. Daily-living measures accounted for 62% of the explained variance, laboratory measures 30%, and demographics and subject characteristics 7% of the explained variance. Conversely, demographics and subject characteristics, laboratory-based measures of gait symmetry, and motor symptom severity together explained less than 30% of the variance in total daily-living physical activity. MDS-UPDRS-part III scores accounted for 13% of the explained variance, i.e., <4% of all the variance in total daily-living activity.
  Conclusions
  Our findings suggest that conventional measures of motor symptom severity do not strongly reflect daily-living activity and that daily-living measures apparently provide important information that is not captured in a conventional one-time, laboratory assessment of gait, balance or the MDS-UPDRS. To provide a more complete evaluation, wearable devices should be considered.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait, Physical Activity",Wearable,,IMU,,,,
Spin turns in advanced Parkinson's disease: A new clinical gait sign?,"Gavriliuc, Olga; Paschen, Steffen; Andrusca, Alexandru; Berg, Daniela; Schlenstedt, Christian; Deuschl, GÃƒÂ¼nther",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Parkinson's disease, Turning strategy, Deep brain stimulation","Objective
  Two strategies are known for turning while walking: step turns (the direction change is performed with 3 steps or more) and spin turns (turning on one/both feet simultaneously). It is unknown which strategy patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) choose and if l-dopa and STN-DBS are influencing this strategy.
  Methods
  Video-recordings of 171 PD patients that completed 180Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° turns were analyzed by two blinded raters before surgery, both off and on l-dopa, and one year after STN-DBS-implantation. The strategies were classified: 1) spin 2) step and 3) mixed (spin plus step) strategy. The characteristics of the patients with different strategies were compared.
  Results
  Interrater reliability for classification of turning strategy showed high agreement (ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Âº = 0.894). The distribution of the preferred strategy differed significantly between treatment conditions (untreated, treated with l-dopa, l-dopa plus stimulation; X2(4) = 67.2, p < 0.0001). The spin turn was found in 10.5% of patients OFF-drug, 23.5% ON-drug and in 38.8% ON-drug/ON-stim condition. In the three treatment conditions patients with spin turns had significantly lower UPDRS III scores compared to people with step turns (p = 0.017, p = 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively); step turn patients had poorer postural instability and gait disorders (PIGD) scores (p = 0.04, p = 0.002, p = 0.04, respectively).
  Conclusion
  The turn strategy can be reliably identified in clinical settings and is a simple motor sign. The spin turn is associated with better motor performance. Since improvements in motor score in patients with fluctuations are also related to behavioral changes, we cannot exclude that the turn strategy also represents a feature of psycho-motor interaction.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Gait,Video Recording,,Camera,,,,

Brain responses recorded via the 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system in an electromagnetically and acoustically isolated room. The auditory stimuli (1500 Hz, 60 dB SPL, 500 ms) were delivered to the subjects via a headphone. The inter-stimulus interval was ranged between 2.5-4.5 s. The peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes were measured in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands on 11 electrodes (including the frontal, central and parietal areas) for the statistical analysis in which one-way ANOVA test was employed for the comparisons between PD and HC. For the delta oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in frontal, central and parietal areas in comparison with HC. For the theta and alpha oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in parietal areas in comparison with HC. As a result, amplitudes of brain oscillatory responses in PD group were significantly bigger than the HC. In this context, decreased inhibitory mechanisms of cortical auditory processing due to the dysfunction of the dopaminergic activity may lead the increased evoked responses in PD group.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,,BioPotential,Cueing,"EEG, Audio Cueing",,,,

  A precise understanding of the neuronal circuits involved in the control of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) for gait initiation is missing. Neurostimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) provides a method of modulating APAs to gain insight into the underlying circuitry.
  Objective
  Our objective was to investigate if APA kinematics for step initiation could be modulated by high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in people with PD and Freezing of gait (FoG).
  Methods
  We studied 14 people with PD and FoG using neurostimulation of the STN and SNr areas after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication on the instrumented stand and walk test. We tested patients in the following randomized conditions: 'off stimulation', 'STN' stimulation (only), and 'SNr' stimulation (only). Patients were blinded to the stimulation condition. The APAs were recorded with inertial sensors and processed offline. Moreover, we assessed clinical scores with respect to motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, executive function, and FoG.
  Results
  SNr but not STN stimulation modulated the anterio-posterior size of APA. The SNr modulation of APA was associated with the stimulation effect on FoG (trend; r = 0.580, P = 0.102). The APA modulation was not correlated with any other cognitive or clinical measures.
  Conclusion
  Neuromodulation of the SNr but not of the STN modulated APAs in PD patients with FoG. The different effects of STN or SNr on the kinematic parameters of APA support the concept of segregate targets in order to address diverse kinematic components of PD gait.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,"Freezing of gait, motor symptoms",Wearable,,IMU,,,,

  Motor fluctuations between akinetic (medication OFF) and mobile phases (medication ON) states are one of the most prevalent complications of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). There is a need for a technology-based system to provide reliable information about the duration in different medication phases that can be used by the treating physician to successfully adjust therapy.
  Methods
  Two KinetiSense motion sensors were mounted on the most affected wrist and ankle of 19 PD subjects (age: 42-77, 14 males) and collected movement signals as the participants performed seven daily living activities in their medication OFF and ON phases. A feature selection and a classification algorithm based on support vector machine with fuzzy labeling was developed to detect medication ON/OFF states using gyroscope signals. The algorithm was trained using approximately 15% of the data from four activities and tested on the remaining data.
  Results
  The algorithm was able to detect medication ON and OFF states with 90.5% accuracy, 94.2% sensitivity, and 85.4% specificity. It performed equally well for all the activities with an average accuracy of 91.3% for the activities that were used in the training phase and 88.4% for the new activities.

  PD0049 was a 12-week pilot study to investigate whether using Kinesia 360 at home could improve motor symptom management in PD patients starting transdermal dopamine agonist rotigotine. Adults with PD and insufficiently controlled motor symptoms (prescribed rotigotine) were randomized 1:1 to Control Group (CG) or Experimental Group (EG) before starting rotigotine. Motor symptoms were assessed in all patients at baseline and Week 12 (W12) using Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) III and Kinesia ONE, which measures standardized motor tasks via a sensor on the index finger. Between baseline and W12, EG used Kinesia 360 at home; clinicians used the data to supplement standard care in adjusting rotigotine dosage.

  At W12, least squares mean improvements in UPDRS II (ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™2.1 vs 0.5, p = 0.004) and UPDRS III (ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™5.3 vs ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™1.0, pÃƒâ€šÃ‚ =Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 0.134) were clinically meaningfully greater, and mean rotigotine dosage higher (4.8 vs 3.9 mg/24Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ h) in EG (nÃƒâ€šÃ‚ =Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 19) vs CG (nÃƒâ€šÃ‚ =Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 20). Mean rotigotine dosage increase (+2.8 vsÃƒâ€šÃ‚ +Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 1.9 mg/24Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ h) and mean number of dosage changes (2.8 vs 1.8) during the study were higher in EG vs CG. Tolerability and retention rates were similar.

  Continuous, objective, motor symptom monitoring using a wearable biosensor as an adjunct to standard care may enhance clinical decision-making, and may improve outcomes in PD patients starting rotigotine.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Limb movements,Wearable,,Not clear,,,,
Source activity during emotion processing and its relationship to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,"Iyer, Kartik K.; Au, Tiffany R.; Angwin, Anthony J.; Copland, David A.; Dissanayaka, Nadeeka N. W.",2019,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Parkinson's disease, Cognitive impairment, Event-related potentials, Source imaging, Affective priming paradigm","Background
  Neural mechanisms contributing to an underlying cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. An effective method to probe cognitive processing deficits in PD is the examination of brain activity during emotional processes, particularly in explicit language emotion recognition contexts.
  Methods
  The present study utilised cortical source imaging of event related potentials (ERP) from electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate valence judgements on negative and neutral target words in an automatic affective priming paradigm. Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed affective priming tasks during EEG monitoring. Cognitive impairment was measured using the validated Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS).
  Results
  Results reveal that compared to healthy age-matched controls, PD patients demonstrate a reduced N400 activation during affective priming tasks in bilateral regions of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and, notably, have a late wave ERP component (LPP) in left MFG, present between 600 and 800 ms, following family-wise error correction (pFWE < 0.05). LPP in PD patients were significantly associated with PD-CRS scores.
  Limitations
  Although affective priming paradigms are an effective means for various domains of cognition, it is not a focused cognitive behavioural test for cognitive dysfunction. Our study is thus limited to a surrogate measure of cognitive dysfunction via examination of emotional word processing cues.
  Conclusions
  These findings suggest that source imaging methods with ERP paradigms in PD are effective in identifying delayed cognitive processes in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Cortical Activity,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,
Evaluation of a sensor algorithm for motor state rating in Parkinson's disease,"Johansson, Dongni; Thomas, Ilias; Ericsson, Anders; Johansson, Anders; Medvedev, Alexander; Memedi, Mevludin; Nyholm, Dag; Ohlsson, Fredrik; Senek, Marina; Spira, Jack; Westin, Jerker; Bergquist, Filip",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Levodopa challenge test, Independent evaluation, Wearable sensors, Parkinson's disease, Machine learning algorithms","Introduction
  A treatment response objective index (TRIS) was previously developed based on sensor data from pronation-supination tests. This study aimed to examine the performance of TRIS for medication effects in a new population sample with Parkinson's disease (PD) and its usefulness for constructing individual dose-response models.
  Methods
  Twenty-five patients with PD performed a series of tasks throughout a levodopa challenge while wearing sensors. TRIS was used to determine motor changes in pronation-supination tests following a single levodopa dose, and was compared to clinical ratings including the Treatment Response Scale (TRS) and six sub-items of the UPDRS part III.
  Results
  As expected, correlations between TRIS and clinical ratings were lower in the new population than in the initial study. TRIS was still significantly correlated to TRS (rs = 0.23, P < 0.001) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.33. For the patients (n = 17) with a good levodopa response and clear motor fluctuations, a stronger correlation was found (rs = 0.38, RMSE = 1.29, P < 0.001). The mean TRIS increased significantly when patients went from the practically defined off to their best on state (P = 0.024). Individual dose-response models could be fitted for more participants when TRIS was used for modelling than when TRS ratings were used.
  Conclusion
  The objective sensor index shows promise for constructing individual dose-response models, but further evaluations and retraining of the TRIS algorithm are desirable to improve its performance and to ensure its clinical effectiveness.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Limb movements,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

  To investigate whether baseline electromyography (EMG) activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predicts the development of neurodegenerative diseases over time in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).
  Methods
  A total of 216 patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD were recruited from September 1997 to December 2016 with a mean follow-up duration of 5.0Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 3.7 years (median: 4.0, range: 0.5-19.0). Neurodegenerative diseases were ascertained according to standard diagnostic criteria during follow-up. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to evaluate the dynamic predictive performance of EMG activity over time. Both tonic and phasic EMG activity were dichotomized into 'mild' and 'severe' categories by the ROC curves estimated optimal cut-offs.
  Results
  A total of 58 patients (26.9%) developed neurodegenerative diseases. The predictive performance of tonic EMG activity was stable (area under the curve of approximately 0.68) over time, while the performance of phasic EMG activity was significantly superior to chance only after five years of follow-up. The optimal cut-off for prediction at five years was 15.4% (sensitivity, 0.69; specificity, 0.57) and 7.8% (sensitivity, 0.79; specificity, 0.47) for tonic and phasic EMG activity, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses further revealed that severe tonic (adjusted HR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.35-5.62) and phasic EMG activity (adjusted HR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.10-8.71) were associated with early development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), respectively.
  Conclusions
  Tonic but not phasic EMG activity may serve as a stable biomarkers for predicting the progression of neurodegeneration in iRBD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Sleep topics,BioPotential,,EMG,,,,

Arm rest tremors were video filmed and scored by two independent raters using the motor subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). The tremor intensity parameter was defined by the root mean square of the angular speed measured by the smartwatch at the wrist. Sixty-four smartwatch evaluations were completed. The Spearman coefficient among the mean of the resting tremor (UPDRS-III) scores and smartwatch measurements for tremor intensity was 0.81 (p < .001); smartwatch reliability to quantify tremors was checked by intraclass reliability coefficient with a resting tremor = 0.89, minimum detectable change = 59.03%.

  To investigate EEG changes during an auditory odd-ball task while walking (dual-task) in young adults, older adults, and patients with Parkinson's disease.
  Methods
  11 young adults, 10 older adults, and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) performed an auditory oddball task during standing and walking on a treadmill, while wearing a wireless EEG cap. The amplitude and latency of P300 were compared between groups and within conditions using linear mix model analysis. Gait was evaluated using wearable sensors and cognition was assessed using the Color Trail Test.
  Results
  P300 latency became longer during walking in all groups (p = 0.005). During walking, older adults (p = 0.005) and patients with PD (p = 0.001) showed prolonged P300 latency compared to young adults. Significant task by group interaction was found in P300 amplitude (p = 0.008). Patients with PD demonstrated reduced P300 amplitude during walking compared to standing (p = 0.023). Among all subjects, better motor and cognitive performance correlated with shorter P300 latency (r = 0.457, p = 0.014 and r = 0.431, p = 0.040, respectively).
  Conclusions
  These findings provide direct evidence of the physiological recruitment of attentional networks during walking and their impact by ageing and disease.

Pre-stimulus beta power modulation during motor sequence learning is reduced in 'Parkinson's disease,"Meissner, Sarah Nadine; Krause, Vanessa; SÃƒÂ¼dmeyer, Martin; Hartmann, Christian Johannes; Pollok, Bettina",2019,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Beta oscillations, SRTT, Anticipatory motor control, Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Parkinson's disease (PD)","Beta oscillations within motor-cortical areas have been linked to sensorimotor function. In line with this, pathologically altered beta activity in cortico-basal ganglia pathways has been suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by motor impairment. Although its precise function is still discussed, beta activity might subserve an anticipatory role in preparation of future actions. By reanalyzing previously published data, we aimed at investigating the role of pre-stimulus motor-cortical beta power modulation in motor sequence learning and its alteration in PD. 20 PD patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) in which reaction time gain presumably reflects the ability to anticipate subsequent sequence items. Randomly varying patterns served as control trials. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and data was reanalyzed with respect to task stimuli onset. Assuming that pre-stimulus beta power modulation is functionally related to motor sequence learning, reaction time gain due to training on the SRTT should vary depending on the amount of beta power suppression prior to stimulus onset. We hypothesized to find less pre-stimulus beta power suppression in PD patients as compared to HC associated with reduced motor sequence learning in patients. Behavioral analyses revealed that PD patients exhibited smaller reaction time gain in sequence relative to random control trials than HC indicating reduced learning in PD. This finding was indeed paralleled by reduced pre-stimulus beta power suppression in PD patients. Further strengthening its functional relevance, the amount of pre-stimulus beta power suppression during sequence training significantly predicted subsequent reaction time advantage in sequence relative to random trials in patients. In conclusion, the present data provide first evidence for the contribution of pre-stimulus motor-cortical beta power suppression to motor sequence learning and support the hypothesis that beta oscillations may subserve an anticipatory, predictive function, possibly compromised in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,gait,BioPotential,,MEG,,,,

  Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by gait disturbances, which become severe during the advanced stages of the disease. Though gait impairments in Parkinson's disease have been extensively described in terms of spatiotemporal gait parameters, little is known regarding associated patterns of cortical activity. The objective of the present study is to test if interhemispheric synchronization differs between participants with PD and healthy elderly controls (NPD). We analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded during bilateral movements, i.e., locomotion and hand tapping.
  Methods
  Fifteen participants with PD ('OFF' their anti-parkinsonian medications) and eight NPD were assessed during quiet standing, straight-line walking, turning, and hand tapping tasks. Using a 32-electrode EEG array, we quantified the synchronization in periodic cortical activation between the brain hemispheres (interhemispheric phase synchronization; inter-PS). Theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands were evaluated.
  Results
  In all bands, inter-PS was significantly higher for the PD group as compared with the NPD group during standing and walking (p < 0.001) and during bimanual tasks (p = 0.026).
  Conclusions
  Persons with PD exhibit increased inter-PS as compared with NPD participants. These findings support previous evidence from animal studies, that bilateral cortical hypersynchronization emerges from the asymmetric neural degeneration that is at the base of the disease. Future studies should elucidate the long-term temporal development of this hypersynchronization and its clinical relevance (e.g., can it 'serve' as prodromal marker?).",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,EEG abnormalities,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

  Gait and balance impairments are cardinal features of Parkinson's disease (PD) that require cognitive input. However, the extent to which specific gait and balance characteristics relate to cognition in PD is unclear. In addition, independent models of gait and balance have not been developed from the same cohort. We aimed to i) develop models of gait and balance in a large PD cohort and ii) determine which gait and balance characteristics best related to cognition.
  Methods
  One hundred and ninety-eight people with PD were recruited to the Pacific Udall Center. Using six inertial sensors (APDM, Inc.), comprehensive gait measurements were collected over a 2-min continuous walk and comprehensive static balance measures were collected during a 60-second standing task. Six domains of cognition were assessed: global cognition, attention, executive function, language, memory, and visuospatial function. Correlations and hierarchical linear regression determined independent associations.
  Results
  Principal components analysis identified a gait model containing four domains accounting for 80.1% of total variance: pace/turning, rhythm, variability, and trunk. The balance model contained four independent domains accounting for 84.5% of total variance: sway area/jerkiness, sway velocity, sway frequency anteroposterior, and sway frequency mediolateral. Gait domains of pace/turning and variability were strongly associated with attention and executive function. Sway area and jerkiness of balance associated with attention and visuospatial function.
  Conclusions
  Gait and balance characteristics were associated with specific types of cognition. The specific relationships between gait or balance with cognitive functions suggests shared cerebral cortical circuitry for mobility and cognitive functions.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait, Balance",Wearable,,IMU sensors(APDM: Gyroscope + accelerometer),,,,

This methodology entails extracting feature sets of a recorded person's voice then utilizing a machine learning technique to identify the healthy and Parkinson's cases from the voice. This paper attempts to improve the diagnoses of Parkinson's disease by testing multiple feature evaluation and classification machine learning methods based on the voice disorders analysis.

The methodology of the tests encompasses 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the learning of methods and track variation in their performance. The test results show that the MFEA of the multi-agent system finds the best set of features and improves the performance of the classifiers.

  Parkinson's Disease (PD) is frequently associated with cognitive dysfunction ranging from Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) to dementia. Few electrophysiological studies are available evaluating potential pathogenetic mechanisms linked to cognitive impairment in PD since its initial phases. The objective of the study is to analyze electrocortical networks related with cognitive decline in PD-MCI for identifying possible early electrophysiological markers of cognitive impairment in PD.
  Methods
  From the PaCoS (Parkinson's disease Cognitive impairment Study) cohort, a sample of 102 subjects including 46 PD-MCI and 56 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) was selected based on the presence of a neuropsychological assessment and at least one EEG recording. EEG signal epochs were analysed using Independent Component Analysis LORETA and spectral analysis by computing the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of site-specific signal epochs.
  Results
  LORETA analysis revealed significant differences in PD-MCI patients compared to PD-NC, with a decreased network involving alpha activity over the occipital lobe, an increased network involving beta activity over the frontal lobe associated with a reduction over the parietal lobe, an increased network involving theta and delta activity over the frontal lobe and a reduction of networks involving theta and delta activity in the parietal lobe. Quantitative EEG analysis showed a significant decrease of alpha PSD over the occipital regions and an increase of delta PSD over the left temporal region in PD-MCI as compared to PD-NC.
  Conclusion
  Electrocortical abnormalities detected in PD-MCI patients may represent the instrumental counterpart of early cognitive decline in PD.",,,Diagnosis,Cognitive Activity,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

Besides dysfunction of the basal ganglia network, alterations of cortical oscillatory coupling, particularly between prefrontal and (pre-)motoric areas, are thought to underlie this impairment. Here, we studied 16 PD patients OFF and ON medication and age-matched healthy controls recording high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) during performance of spatially coupled and uncoupled bimanual finger movements. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for induced responses was used to infer task-induced effective connectivity within a network comprising bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary motor area (SMA), and primary motor cortex (M1). Performing spatially coupled movements, excitatory left-hemispheric PFC to lPM coupling was significantly stronger in controls compared to unmedicated PD patients. Levodopa-induced enhancement of this connection correlated with increased movement accuracy. During performance of spatially uncoupled movements, PD patients OFF medication exhibited inhibitory connectivity from left PFC to SMA. Levodopa intake diminished these inhibitory influences and restored excitatory PFC to lPM coupling. This restoration, however, did not improve motor function. Concluding, our results indicate that lateralization of prefrontal to premotor connectivity in PD can be augmented by levodopa substitution and is of compensatory nature up to a certain extent of complexity.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

  40% of Parkinson's Disease (PD) sufferers experience insomnia, impacting health and quality of life for patients and family members, especially carers. There is little evidence that current treatments are effective.
  Objectives
  To determine the effectiveness of melatonin in reducing insomnia in 44 individuals with PD using N-of-1 trials. To aggregate group data to arrive at population estimates of effectiveness (measured by improvements in PDSS-2) and safety (measured by adverse events) of melatonin in improving insomnia in PD. To assess the feasibility of offering N-of-1 trials for insomnia in PD.
  Methodology
  Participants will receive either immediate-release melatonin or placebo in random order in 3 paired two-week treatment periods (12 weeks total). Based on their response in a two-week run-in period on 3 mg daily, they will trial either 3 mg or 6 mg. Patients will keep daily sleep diaries and wear a MotionWatch throughout. After the trial patients will discuss their individual report with their doctor, which provides direct feedback about effectiveness and safety of melatonin for them.
  Statistical methods
  We will analyse N-of-1 tests 1) individually: effects of melatonin on PDSS-2 and safety will be reported; and 2) aggregated across individual N-of-1 studies, combined using a Bayesian multilevel random effects model, which will account for repeated measures on individuals over time, and will return posterior estimates of overall treatment effect, and effect in each individual.

Patients with brain lesions involving the motor system are characterized by deficits in action verbs processing in the absence of dementia. We sought to assess whether action verbs interfere with the motor behavior of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) having tremor dominant symptoms. PD tremor is considered to result from dysfunction of cortical-subcortical motor circuits driven by dopamine depletion. In addition, PD tremor is reduced during active movement execution. Therefore, likewise movement execution, the motor simulation of bodily actions predicted by the embodiment may show to be effective in modifying tremor by interfering with a dysfunctional motor system. Here, we asked to simply read and repeat words expressing a hand-related bodily action. Abstract verbs served as control. Changes in tremor kinematics were evaluated using a monoaxial accelerometer. Seventeen PD patients with rest tremor of the upper limbs were enrolled. Tremor amplitude was significantly smaller when reading action verbs as compared to abstract verbs.

A palm-worn device to quantify rigidity in Parkinson's disease,"Perera, Thushara; Lee, Wee-Lih; Jones, Mary; Tan, Joy L.; Proud, Elizabeth L.; Begg, Angus; Sinclair, Nicholas C.; Peppard, Richard; McDermott, Hugh J.",2019,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,"Rigidity, Stiffness, Parkinson's disease, Objective monitoring, Movement disorders","Background
  Parkinsonian rigidity is identified on clinical examination as resistance to passive movement. Measurement of rigidity commonly relies on ordinal rating scales (MDS-UPDRS), however instrumented objective measures may provide greater mechanistic insight.
  New method
  We present a palm-worn instrument to objectively quantify rigidity on a continuous scale. The device employs a miniature motor to flex the third digit of the hand about the metacarpophalangeal joint whilst transducers record flexion/extension forces. We aim to determine congruence with the MDS-UPDRS, investigate sensitivity to the impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and contralateral movement, and make comparisons with healthy individuals. Eight participants with Parkinson's disease underwent evaluation during conditions: on and off DBS, and with and without contralateral limb movement to activate rigidity. During each DBS condition, wash-in/out effects were tracked using both our instrument and two blinded clinical raters. Sixteen healthy volunteers (age-matched/young) served as controls.
  Results
  Rigidity measured using our instrument had moderate agreement with the MDS-UPDRS and showed differences between therapeutic state, activation conditions, and disease/healthy cohorts. Rigidity gradually worsened over a one-hour period after DBS cessation, but improved more rapidly with DBS resumption.
  Comparison with existing methods
  Previous attempts to quantify rigidity include manual approaches where a clinician is required to manipulate limbs while sensors passively gather information, or large automated instruments to move the wrist or elbow.
  Conclusion
  Given its ability to track changes in rigidity due to therapeutic intervention, our technique could have applications where continuous measurement is required or where a suitably qualified rater is absent.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Limb movements,Wearable,,Servo Motor,,,,
Changes in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Related to Freezing of gait in Parkinson's Disease,"Potvin-Desrochers, Alexandra; Mitchell, Trina; Gisiger, Thomas; Paquette, Caroline",2019,Neuroscience,"Freezing of gait, Parkinson's disease, resting-state functional connectivity","Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) thought to arise from the dysfunctional cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuity. The purpose of this study was to assess the changes in brain resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of subcortical structures comprising the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuity in individuals with PD with and without FOG. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 27 individuals with idiopathic PD (14 with FOG and 13 without FOG). A seed-to-voxel analysis was performed with the seeds in the bilateral basal ganglia nuclei, thalamus, and pedunculopontine nucleus. Between-group differences in rs-FC revealed that the bilateral thalamus and globus pallidus external were significantly more connected with visual areas in PD with FOG compared to PD without FOG. In addition, PD with FOG had increased connectivity between the left putamen and retrosplenial cortex as well as with the cerebellum. Our findings suggest an increased connectivity at rest of subcortical and cortical regions involved in sensory and visuospatial processing that may be compensating for sensorimotor deficits in FOG. This increased connectivity may contribute to the hypothesized overload in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuity processing capacity, which may ultimately result in FOG occurrence.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,BioPotential,,MRI,,,,

We demonstrate the potential of voice in serving as a deep phenotype for Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, by presenting methodology for voice signal processing for clinical analysis. Detection of PD symptoms typically requires an exam by a movement disorder specialist and can be hard to access and inconsistent in findings. A vocal digital biomarker could supplement the cumbersome existing manual exam by detecting and quantifying symptoms to guide treatment. Specifically, vocal biomarkers of PD are a potentially effective method of assessing symptoms and severity in daily life, which is the focus of the current research. We analyzed a database of PD patient and non-PD subjects containing voice recordings that were used to extract paralinguistic features, which served as inputs to machine learning models to predict PD severity. The results are presented here and the limitations are discussed given the nature of the recordings. We note that our methodology only advances biomarker research and is not cleared for clinical use. Specifically, we demonstrate that conventional machine learning models applied to voice signals can be used to differentiate participants with PD who exhibit little to no symptoms from healthy controls. This work highlights the potential of voice to be used for early detection of PD and indicates that voice may serve as a deep phenotype for PD, enabling precision medicine by improving the speed, accuracy, accessibility, and cost of PD management.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,

The average feet interval was larger in ataxic subjects than in control subjects. The stride length coefficient of variation (CV), gait rhythm CV, and average and standard deviations of the A/L ratio were larger in ataxic or Parkinson's disease subjects than in control subjects. Ataxic subjects exhibited significant positive correlations between the CV of stride length or average feet interval and scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia scores or international cooperative ataxia rating scale scores. Parkinson's disease subjects exhibited a significant correlation between the average stride length, CV of stride length, or standard deviation of A/L ratio and unified Parkinson's disease rating scale score. The device used in this study differentiated the characteristics of gait disturbance in each movement disorder and quantitatively evaluated ataxia or Parkinson's disease severity, indicating its potential clinical utility across applications.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Other,Motion capture device,depth sensor and an infrared ray sensor,,,,
A novel octopus based Parkinson's disease and gender recognition method using vowels,"Tuncer, Turker; Dogan, Sengul",2019,Applied Acoustics,"Octopus based method, Parkinson's disease recognition, Gender classification, Singular value decomposition, Vowel processing, Machine learning","The Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the widely seen and most important neurological disorders worldwide. With the development of the technology, many machine learning methods have been presented to recognize PD automatically. In order to recognize PD and gender, vowels have been widely used and many papers have been presented for solving these problems in the literature. In this study, a novel octopus based feature extraction network is presented and the proposed octopus is a multiple pooling method. In this method, minimum, maximum, maximum-minimum, average, variance, median, skewness and kurtosis pooling methods are used. These eight pooling methods consist the leg of the octopus. In this article, a vowel recognition method is proposed using the proposed octopus pooling method. The proposed method contains preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, classification and post processing phases. In the preprocessing, the proposed octopus method is applied to signal to generate octopus signal. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is utilized as feature extractor and the features are extracted using original vowel signal and the signals of the octopus. In order to feature selection, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is used to remove redundant features. In the classification phase, support vector machine with various activation functions (linear, cubic, radial bases function), 1NN with Manhattan distance, tree and logistic regression are utilized. To obtain individual results, the proposed post processing algorithm is applied to validation predictions. In order to show success of the proposed method, a vowel dataset is used. This dataset contains PD disease vowels and there are gender labels. By using the proposed octopus based method, PD, gender and both PD and gender recognitions are performed. The proposed method achieved 99.21%, 98.41% and 97.62% accuracy rates for gender, PD and gender and PD classification respectively using 1 nearest neighbor (1NN) classifier. The space complexity of the proposed method was calculated and was found as Onlogn. These results clearly indicated that the proposed solves three problems with high success rates and low computational complexity.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,
Estimation and validation of temporal gait features using a markerless 2D video system,"Verlekar, Tanmay T.; Vroey, Henri De; Claeys, Kurt; Hallez, Hans; Soares, LuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s D.; Correia, Paulo L.",2019,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,"Biomedical analysis, Biomedical gait indicators, Gait analysis, Temporal gait features, Computer vision, Video processing","Background and objective
  Estimation of temporal gait features, such as stance time, swing time and gait cycle time, can be used for clinical evaluations of various patient groups having gait pathologies, such as Parkinson's diseases, neuropathy, hemiplegia and diplegia. Most clinical laboratories employ an optoelectronic motion capture system to acquire such features. However, the operation of these systems requires specially trained operators, a controlled environment and attaching reflective markers to the patient's body. To allow the estimation of the same features in a daily life setting, this paper presents a novel vision based system whose operation does not require the presence of skilled technicians or markers and uses a single 2D camera.
  Method
  The proposed system takes as input a 2D video, computes the silhouettes of the walking person, and then estimates key biomedical gait indicators, such as the initial foot contact with the ground and the toe off instants, from which several other temporal gait features can be derived.
  Results
  The proposed system is tested on two datasets: (i) a public gait dataset made available by CASIA, which contains 20 users, with 4 sequences per user; and (ii) a dataset acquired simultaneously by a marker-based optoelectronic motion capture system and a simple 2D video camera, containing 10 users, with 5 sequences per user. For the CASIA gait dataset A the relevant temporal biomedical gait indicators were manually annotated, and the proposed automated video analysis system achieved an accuracy of 99% on their identification. It was able to obtain accurate estimations even on segmented silhouettes where, the state-of-the-art markerless 2D video based systems fail. For the second database, the temporal features obtained by the proposed system achieved an average intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.86, when compared to the ``gold standard""Ã‚Â optoelectronic motion capture system.
  Conclusions
  The proposed markerless 2D video based system can be used to evaluate patients' gait without requiring the usage of complex laboratory settings and without the need for physical attachment of sensors/markers to the patients. The good accuracy of the results obtained suggests that the proposed system can be used as an alternative to the optoelectronic motion capture system in non-laboratory environments, which can be enable more regular clinical evaluations.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Video Recording,,Camera,,,,Also Diagnosis

Turning manoeuvres are affected by age, neurological disorders, or frailty. Analyses of the walking turn and its alterations could provide valuable information about functional independence. Most studies involving wearable sensors quantify the turn by descriptive statistical values such as the mean or maximum of the signal. Along with growing interest in walking turn analysis, new parameters should be proposed. From statistics we adapted a parameter, referred to as waveform skewness, that describes the shape of the 180 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° turn signal. This parameter is then compared to established ones and an intraclass-correlation is calculated. The mutual relationship between the proposed parameter and established ones is investigated via correlation. In addition, the effect of different circumstances (temporal alignment, signal scaling and time shift) to the proposed parameter is quantified. Waveform skewness showed a moderate intra-class correlation and a high correlation with the signal peak value. The results showed that waveform skewness is not sensitive to the time shift but is sensitive to signal scaling and temporal alignment. Comparing the waveform skewness between the two subject groups revealed significant differences between Parkinson disease patients and the control group. Quantitative assessment of the 180 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° turn may allow for more objective and sensitive determinations of movement disorders and pathologies.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Wearable,,gyro-accelerometers,100hz,,,
Quantitative mobility metrics from a wearable sensor predict incident parkinsonism in older adults,"von Coelln, Rainer; Dawe, Robert J.; Leurgans, Sue E.; Curran, Thomas A.; Truty, Timothy; Yu, Lei; Barnes, Lisa L.; Shulman, Joshua M.; Shulman, Lisa M.; Bennett, David A.; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.; Buchman, Aron S.",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Parkinsonism, Gait testing, Biosensor, Accelerometry, Longitudinal","Introduction
  Mobility metrics derived from wearable sensor recordings are associated with parkinsonism in older adults. We examined if these metrics predict incident parkinsonism.
  Methods
  Parkinsonism was assessed annually in 683 ambulatory, community-dwelling older adults without parkinsonism at baseline. Four parkinsonian signs were derived from a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Parkinsonism was based on the presence of 2 or more signs. Participants wore a sensor on their back while performing a 32 foot walk, standing posture, and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tasks. 12 mobility scores were extracted. Cox proportional hazards models with backward elimination were used to identify combinations of mobility scores independently associated with incident parkinsonism.
  Results
  During follow-up of 2.5 years (SD = 1.28), 139 individuals developed parkinsonism (20.4%). In separate models, 6 of 12 mobility scores were individually associated with incident parkinsonism, including: Speed and Regularity (from 32 ft walk), Sway (from standing posture), and 3 scores from TUG subtasks (Posterior sit to stand transition, Range stand to sit transition, and Yaw, a measure of turning efficiency). When all mobility scores were analyzed together in a single model, 2 TUG subtask scores, Range from stand to sit transition (HR, 1.42, 95%CI, 1.09, 1.82) and Yaw from turning (HR, 0.56, 95%CI, 0.42, 0.73) were independently associated with incident parkinsonism. These results were unchanged when controlling for chronic health covariates.
  Conclusion
  Mobility metrics derived from a wearable sensor complement conventional gait testing and have potential to enhance risk stratification of older adults who may develop parkinsonism.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,piezoelectric accel- erometers and three gyroscopic sensors,100 hz,,,
Latency of re-emergent tremor in Parkinson's disease is influenced by levodopa,"Wilken, Miguel; Rossi, Malco D.; Rivero, Alberto D.; Hallett, Mark; Merello, Marcelo",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Parkinson's disease, Levodopa, Re-emergent tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, Neurophysiology","Introduction
  Re-emergent tremor (RET) is a common form of postural tremor observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Recent studies have shown that administration of levodopa decreases RET amplitude. However, drug effects on tremor pause duration are less clear.
  Methods
  We performed a prospective observational study in PD patients with RET, subjected to acute levodopa challenge. Tremor activity was measured during OFF and ON states both clinically, as well as by using accelerometers taped to the back of both hands. Correlation between RET amplitude and pause duration, as well with MDS-UPDRS scores were investigated. The slope of gradual increase of postural tremor after the pause was also measured in the OFF and ON states.
  Results
  Significant inverse correlation between tremor amplitude and RET pause duration was observed in OFF (rs = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™0.474, p = 0.030) and ON (rs = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™0.569, p = 0.006) states. Levodopa reduced tremor amplitude (26%, p = 0.004) dampening slope gradient (22%, p = 0.029). Tremor pause duration also showed inverse correlation with postural tremor amplitude measured by MDS-UPDRS in OFF (rs = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™0.311, p = 0.048) and ON (rs = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™0.503, p = 0.020) states, as well as with total MDS-UPDRS Part III score (rs = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ë†Ã‚â€™0.295, p = 0.009). Finally, accelerometric analysis proved to be more sensitive than visual inspection for detecting tremor pauses.
  Conclusion
  Our results suggest RET pause duration is amplitude related, since levodopa-induced amplitude decrease led to pause prolongation, associated with decreased tremor intensity and slope gradient dampening.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Tremor,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,
Investigating the perceived timing of sensory events triggering actions in patients with Parkinson's disease and the effects of dopaminergic therapy,"Yabe, Yoshiko; Goodale, Melvyn A.; MacDonald, Penny A.",2019,Cortex,"Libet's clock, Temporal binding, Parkinson's disease, Dopamine, Aging","Few studies have investigated if Parkinson's disease (PD), advancing age, or exogenous dopamine therapy affect the perceived timing of past events. Here we show a phenomenon of 'temporal repulsion' of a sensory event relative to an action decision in patients with PD. In these patients, the timing of a sensory event triggering an action was perceived to have occurred earlier in time than it really did. In other words, the event appeared to be pushed away in time from the performance of the action. This finding stands in sharp contrast to the 'temporal binding' we have observed here and elsewhere (Yabe etÃƒâ€šÃ‚ al., 2017; Yabe & Goodale, 2015) in young healthy participants for whom the perceived onset of a sensory event triggering an action is typically delayed, as if it were pulled towards the action in time. In elderly patients, sensory events were neither repulsed nor pulled toward the action decision event. Exogenous dopamine alleviated the temporal repulsion in PD patients and normalized the temporal binding in healthy elderly controls. In contrast, dopaminergic therapy worsened temporal binding in healthy young participants. We discuss this pattern of findings, relating temporal binding processes to dopaminergic and striatal mechanisms.",10<n<=20,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia,Cueing,,Audio cue,,,,

Both methods were developed in MATLAB platform by managing and analyzing motion data in graphical user interface (GUI) form. By attaching the wearable sensors to each segments of interest, the collected data can be reconstructed in real time basis. Artificial intelligence technique is proposed to classify the subjects' motions. Data reconstruction technique can be used to regenerate the motion of subjects' limbs movement in 2D representation. Corresponding tests are performed to validate the accuracy of the application. The application is potentially to be used to access the quality of human motion in hospitals, clinics and human motion research. An experiment was set up in a laboratory environment for data collecting. Subjects were asked to perform three shape drawings using left and right hands. The instruments demonstrate adequate internal consistency of optimum average accuracy of 52 % for decision tree and 80 % for principle component analysis. Results were presented in tabular, image and graphical forms.

Here, we report a new universal body motion sensor (UBS) to detect motions based on the intrinsic contact electrification (CE) of the skin or electrical induction (EI) of the body. The CE or EI generates charges on the body, leading to potential differences between the body and ground that can be measured to identify different body motions, such as motions of the head, arms, fingers, waist, legs, feet and toes.

Altered EEG alpha and theta oscillations characterize apathy in Parkinson's disease during incentivized movement,"Zhu, Maria; HajiHosseini, Azadeh; Baumeister, Tobias R.; Garg, Saurabh; Appel-Cresswell, Silke; McKeown, Martin J.",2019,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Apathy, Parkinson's disease, Motivation, EEG, Oscillations, Alpha, Theta","Apathy is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is difficult to quantify and poorly understood. Some studies have used incentivized motor tasks to assess apathy, as the condition is often associated with a reduction in motivated behavior. Normally event-related desynchronization, a reduction of power in specific frequency bands, is observed in the motor cortex during the peri-movement period. Also, alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) oscillations are sensitive to rewards that are closely related to motivational states however these oscillations have not been widely investigated in relation to apathy in PD. Using EEG recordings, we investigated the neural oscillatory characteristics of apathy in PD during an incentivized motor task with interleaved rest periods. Apathetic and non-apathetic PD subjects on dopaminergic medication and healthy control subjects were instructed to squeeze a hand grip device for a monetary reward proportional to the subject's grip force and the monetary value attributed to that trial. Apathetic PD subjects exhibited higher alpha and theta powers in the pre-trial baseline rest period compared to non-apathetic PD subjects and healthy subjects. Further, we found that both resting power and relative power in alpha and theta bands during incentivized movement predicted PD subjects' apathy scores. Our results suggest that apathetic PD patients may need to overcome greater baseline alpha and theta oscillatory activity in order to facilitate incentivized movement. Clinically, resting alpha and theta power as well as alpha and theta event-related desynchronization during movement may serve as potential neural markers for apathy severity in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

In particular, medical specialists refer to the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sponsored revision of Unified ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease Rating Scale) that is the most widely used clinical scale for PD rating. However, clinical scales rely on the observation of some subtle motor phenomena that are either difficult to capture with human eyes or could be misclassified. This limitation motivated several researchers to develop intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms able to automatically recognize the PD. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies investigated the classification between healthy subjects and PD patients without considering the automatic rating of different levels of severity. In this context, we implemented a simple and low-cost clinical tool that can extract postural and kinematic features with the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor in order to classify and rate PD. Thirty participants were enrolled for the purpose of the present study: sixteen PD patients rated according to MDS-UPDRS and fourteen healthy paired subjects. In order to investigate the motor abilities of the upper and lower body, we acquired and analyzed three main motor tasks: (1) gait, (2) finger tapping, and (3) foot tapping. After preliminary feature selection, different classifiers based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were trained and evaluated for the best solution. Concerning the gait analysis, results showed that the ANN classifier performed the best by reaching 89.4% of accuracy with only nine features in diagnosis PD and 95.0% of accuracy with only six features in rating PD severity. Regarding the finger and foot tapping analysis, results showed that an SVM using the extracted features was able to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients with great performances by reaching 87.1% of accuracy. The results of the classification between mild and moderate PD patients indicated that the foot tapping features were the most representative ones to discriminate (81.0% of accuracy). The results of this study have shown how a low-cost vision-based system can automatically detect subtle phenomena featuring the PD.

In this study, we propose an innovative set of features extracted by geometrical, dynamical and muscle activation signals acquired during handwriting tasks, and evaluate the contribution of such features in detecting and rating PD by means of artificial neural networks. Eleven healthy subjects and twenty-one PD patients were enrolled in this study. Each involved subject was asked to write three different patterns on a graphic tablet while wearing the Myo Armband used to collect the muscle activation signals of the main forearm muscles. We have then extracted several features related to the written pattern, the movement of the pen and the pressure exerted with the pen and the muscle activations. The computed features have been used to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients and to discriminate mild PD patients from moderate PD patients by using an artificial neural network (ANN). After the training and evaluation of different ANN topologies, the obtained results showed that the proposed features have high relevance in PD detection and rating. In particular, we found that our approach both detect and rate (mild and moderate PD) with a classification accuracy higher than 90%.

The outcome measures included the Timed Up and Go test, the modified Gait Abnormality Rating Scale, the modified ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Activity Scale, and the Freezing of gait Questionnaire. The patient completed 17 of the 18 scheduled training sessions and all testing sessions; no adverse events occurred during the rehabilitation program and high satisfaction levels were reported by the patient and family after completion of the 6-week rehabilitation program. Clinically significant improvements were seen in all measures at 6 weeks. The results of this report suggest that a rehabilitation program focused on functional tasks, balance, and gait training using the Electroskip technology may be beneficial for improving gait and balance in a patient with moderate Parkinson disease. Future work is needed to determine the effectiveness of Electroskip technology by means of randomized controlled trials.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait,Cueing,,Auditory cues,,,,
An Ensemble Method for Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease Based on Voice Measurements,"Sheibani, Razieh; Nikookar, Elham; Alavi, Seyed Enayatollah",2019,Journal of Medical Signals and Sensors,"Classification,ensemble learning,medical diagnostics,parkinson's disease,voice measurements","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common destructive neurological disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, there is no specific test such as electroencephalography or blood test for diagnosing the disease. In accordance with the previous studies, about 90% of people with PD have some types of voice abnormalities. Therefore, voice measurements can be used to detect the disease. This study presents an ensemble-based method for identifying patients and healthy samples by class label prediction based on voice frequency characteristics. It includes three stages of data preprocessing, internal classification and ultimate classification. The outcomes of internal classifiers next to primary feature vector of samples are considered the ultimate classifier inputs. According to the results, the proposed method achieved 90.6% of accuracy, 95.8% of sensitivity, and 75% of specificity, admissible compared to those of other relevant studies. Current experimental outcomes provide a comparative analysis of various machine learning classifiers and confirm that using ensemble-based methods has improved medical diagnostic tasks.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,

There are mixed reports on success of physiotherapy in patients with PD. Our objective was to investigate the functional improvements, motivation aspects and clinical effectiveness when using immersive 3D virtual reality versus non-immersive 2D exergaming. We designed a randomized parallel study with 97 patients, but only 20 eligible participants were randomized in 2 groups; the one using 3D Oculus Rift CV1 and the other using a laptop. Both groups participated in the 10-session 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks training with a pick and place task in the virtual world requiring precise hand movement to manipulate the virtual cubes. The kinematics of the hand was traced with Leap motion controller, motivation effect was assessed with modified Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and clinical effectiveness was evaluated with Box & Blocks Test (BBT) and shortened Unified ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease rating scale (UPDRS) before and after the training. Mack-Skilling non-parametrical statistical test was used to identify statistically significant differences ( p Ã‚ <Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and CohenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s U3 test to find the effect sizes. Participants in the 3D group demonstrated statistically significant and substantially better performance in average time of manipulation (group x time, p Ã‚ =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.009), number of successfully placed cubes (group x time, p Ã‚ =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.028), average tremor (group x time, p Ã‚ =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) and UPDRS for upper limb (U3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.35). The LCD and 3D groups substantially improved their BBT score with training (U3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.7, U3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.6, respectively). However, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical tests between the groups (group x time, p Ã‚ =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2189, p Ã‚ =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2850, respectively). In addition the LCD group significantly decreased the pressure/tension (U3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3), the 3D did not show changes (U3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.5) and the differences between the groups were statistically different ( p Ã‚ =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.037). The 3D group demonstrated important increase in effort (U3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.75) and perceived competences (U3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.9). The outcomes of the study demonstrated that the immersive 3D technology may bring increased interests/enjoyment score resulting in faster and more efficient functional performance. But the 2D technology demonstrated lower pressure/tension score providing similar clinical progress.

Ray",2019,NPJ Parkinson's Disease,"Outcomes research,Parkinson's disease","Wearable sensors are becoming increasingly more available in ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease and are used to measure motor function. Whether non-motor symptoms (NMS) can also be measured with these wearable sensors remains unclear. We therefore performed a retrospective, exploratory, analysis of 108 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease enroled in the Non-motor Longitudinal International Study (UKCRN No. 10084) at KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s College Hospital, London, to determine the association between the range and nature of NMS and an accelerometer-based outcome measure of bradykinesia (BKS) and dyskinesia (DKS). NMS were assessed by the validated NMS Scale, and included, e.g., cognition, mood and sleep, and gastrointestinal, urinary and sexual problems. Multiple linear regression modelling was used to identify NMS associated with BKS and DKS. We found that BKS was associated with domains 6 (gastrointestinal tract; p Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006) and 8 (sexual function; p Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) of the NMS scale. DKS was associated with domains 3 (mood/cognition; p Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.016), 4 (perceptual problems; p Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.025), 6 (gastrointestinal tract; p Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.029) and 9 (miscellaneous, p Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003). In the separate domains, constipation was significantly associated with BKS. Delusions, dysphagia, hyposmia, weight change and hyperhidrosis were identified as significantly associated with DKS. None of the NMSS domains were associated with disease duration ( p Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.08). In conclusion, measures of BKS and DKS were mainly associated with gastrointestinal problems, independent of disease duration, showing the potential for wearable devices to pick up on these symptoms. These exploratory results deserve further exploration, and more research on this topic in the form of comprehensive large-scale studies is needed.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

It's hallmark signs and symptoms include slow movements, rigidity, tremor, and unstable posture. Additionally, non-motor symptoms such as sleeplessness, depression, cognitive impairment, impulse control behaviors (ICB) have been reported. Today, treatment regimens to modify disease progression do not exist and as such, treatment is focused on symptom relief. Additionally, physicians are challenged to base their diagnoses and treatment plans on unreliable self-reported symptoms, even when used in conjunction to validated assessments such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and clinical exams. Wearable technology may provide clinicians objective measures of motor problems to supplement current subjective methods. Global Kinetics Corporation (GKC) has developed a watch-device called the Personal KinetiGraph (PKG) that records movements and provides patients medication dosing reminders. A separate clinician-use report supplies longitudinal motor and event data. The PKG was FDA-cleared in September 2016. We studied 63 PD patients during 85 routine care visits in 2 US academic institutions, evaluating the clinical utility of the PKG. Patients wore a PKG for 6 continuous days before their visit. Next, PKG data was uploaded to produce a report. In clinic, physicians discussed PD symptoms with patients and conducted a motor examination prior to reviewing the PKG report and comparing it to their initial assessments. Lastly, patient, caregiver and physician satisfaction surveys were conducted by each user. Across all visits when patients did not report bradykinesia or dyskinesia, the PKG reported these symptoms (50 and 33% of the time, respectively). The PKG provided insights for treatment plans in 50 (79%) patients across 71 (84%) visits. Physicians found improved patient dialogue in 50 (59%) visits, improved ability to assess treatment impact in 32 (38%) visits, and improved motor assessment in 28 (33%) visits. Patients stated in 82% of responses that they agreed or strongly agreed in PKG training, usability, performance, and satisfaction. In 39% of responses, they also reported a very valuable impact on their care.

Wearable Sensors for Estimation of Parkinsonian Tremor Severity during Free Body Movements,"Hssayeni, Murtadha D.; Jimenez-Shahed, Joohi; Burack, Michelle A.; Ghoraani, Behnaz",2019,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","Parkinsonian tremor,continuous monitoring,wearable sensors,gradient tree boosting,deep learning,LSTM","Tremor is one of the main symptoms of ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease (PD) that reduces the quality of life. Tremor is measured as part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III. However, the assessment is based on onsite physical examinations and does not fully represent the patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tremor experience in their day-to-day life. Our objective in this paper was to develop algorithms that, combined with wearable sensors, can estimate total Parkinsonian tremor as the patients performed a variety of free body movements. We developed two methods: an ensemble model based on gradient tree boosting and a deep learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The developed methods were assessed on gyroscope sensor data from 24 PD subjects. Our analysis demonstrated that the method based on gradient tree boosting provided a high correlation ( r = 0.96 using held-out testing and r = 0.93 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation) between the estimated and clinically assessed tremor subscores in comparison to the LSTM-based method with a moderate correlation ( r = 0.84 using held-out testing and r = 0.77 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation).

The objective of the Clinician Input Study was to assess the feasibility and clinical utility of data obtained using a mobile health technology from PD patients. In this observational, exploratory study, PD participants wore a smartwatch and used the Fox Wearable Companion mobile phone app to stream movement data and report symptom severity and medication intake for 6 months. Data were analyzed using the IntelÃ‚Â® Pharma Analytics Platform. Clinicians reviewed participantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ data in a dashboard during in-office visits at 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months. Clinicians provided feedback in focus groups leading to dashboard updates. Between June and August 2017, 51 PD patients were recruited at four US sites, and 39 (76%) completed the 6-month study. Patients streamed 83,432Ã¢â‚¬â€°h of movement data from their smartwatches (91% of expected). Reporting of symptoms and medication intake using the app was lower than expected, 44% and 60%, respectively, but did not differ according to baseline characteristics. CliniciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ feedback resulted in ten updates to the dashboard during the study period. Clinicians reported that medications and patient reported outcomes were generally discernable in the dashboard and complementary to clinical assessments. Movement, symptoms, and medication intake data were feasibly translated from the app into a clinician dashboard but there was substantial attrition rate over 6 months. Further enhancements are needed to ensure long-term patient adherence to portable technologies and optimal digital data transfer to clinicians caring for PD patients.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,Wearable,,SmartWatch IMU,,,,
Dopaminergic Modulation of Sensory Attenuation in Parkinson's Disease: Is There an Underlying Modulation of Beta Power?,"Macerollo, Antonella; Limousin, Patricia; Korlipara, Prasad; Foltynie, Tom; Edwards, Mark J.; Kilner, James",2019,Frontiers in Neurology,"Parkinson's disease,sensory attenuation,beta power,bradykinesia,motor symptoms","Background and Aims: Pathological high amplitude of beta oscillations is thought as the underlying mechanism of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), in particular with regard to bradykinesia. In addition, abnormality in a neurophysiological phenomenon labeled sensory attenuation has been found in patients with PD. The current study explored the hypothesis that the abnormal sensory attenuation has a causal link with the typical abnormality in beta oscillations in PD. Methods: The study tested sixteen right-handed patients with a diagnosis of PD and 22 healthy participants, which were matched by age and gender. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited through electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Electrical activity was recorded at the scalp using a 128 channels EEG. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in 2 conditions: at rest and at the onset of a voluntary movement, which was a self-paced abduction movement of the right thumb. Results: Healthy participants showed a reduction of the N20-P25 amplitude at the onset of the right thumb abduction compared to the rest condition ( P < 0.05). When patients were OFF medication, they showed mild reduction of the N20-P25 component at movement onset ( P < 0.05). On the contrary, they did show greater attenuation of the N20-P25 component at the onset of movement compared to the rest condition when ON medication ( P < 0.05). There was no significant evidence of a link between the degree of sensory attenuation and the change in beta oscillations in our cohort of patients. Conclusion: These results confirmed a significant link between dopaminergic modulation and sensory attenuation. However, the sensory attenuation and beta oscillations were found as two independent phenomena.",10<n<=20,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Limb movements,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

The goal of this study was to analyze the magnitude of correlation between the numeric output of the device algorithm and the results of the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS), administered by a physician. In this study, 13 ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patients, who were symptomatic with dyskinesias, were monitored with the device at home, for an average period of 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°minutes, while performing normal daily life activities. Each patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activity was simultaneously video-recorded. A physician was in charge of reviewing the recorded videos and determining the severity of dyskinesia through the UDysRS for every patient. The sensor device yielded only one value for dyskinesia severity, which was calculated by averaging the recorded device readings. Correlation between the results of physicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assessment and the sensor output was analyzed with the SpearmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient between the sensor output and UDysRS result was 0.70 (CI 95%: 0.33Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.88; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01).

Movement smoothness measurements, such as the spectral arc length (SPARC), are novel approaches to quantify movement quality. Previous studies analyzed SPARC in simple walking conditions. However, SPARC outcomes during functional mobility tasks in subjects with PD and Freezing of gait (FOG) were never investigated. This study aimed to analyze SPARC during the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test in individuals with PD and FOG. Thirty-one participants with PD and FOG and six healthy controls were included. SPARC during TUG test was calculated for linear and angular accelerations using an inertial measurement unit system. SPARC data were correlated with clinical parameters: motor section of the Unified ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn & Yahr scale, Freezing of gait Questionnaire, and TUG test. We reported lower SPARC values (reduced smoothness) during the entire TUG test, turn and stand to sit in subjects with PD and FOG, compared to healthy controls. Unlike healthy controls, individuals with PD and FOG displayed a broad spectral range that encompassed several dominant frequencies. SPARC metrics also correlated with all the above-mentioned clinical parameters.

Although spatiotemporal characteristics of FOG are well-described, their underlying neuromuscular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Several studies have demonstrated an abnormal activation of distal muscles of the lower limb and coordination impairments during gait in people with PD (pwPD). However, few have investigated how various characteristics of electromyograms (EMGs) change before, during and after a freezing episode (FE). Our objective was to quantify changes in proximal and distal leg muscle activity associated with FEs. In this study, 12 pwPD, confirmed as freezers, performed a repetitive stepping-in-place task used to elicit FE. Surface EMGs were collected from proximal [rectus femoris and biceps femoris (BF)] and distal [tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM)] muscles. Data epochs of 500 ms were extracted from EMG time series at four different periods: baseline, 2 s before a FE, during a FE, and 2 s after a FE. For each epoch, EMG amplitude [root-mean-square (RMS)], variability [coefficient of variation (CoV)], and inter-muscle functional connectivity (mutual information) were quantified. Results from the analysis of 21 FEs show a significant main effect of Period for EMG amplitude in bilateral TA and in the least affected GM ( p < 0.01), with decreased activation before freezing that remained low during and after the FE. On the other hand, a main effect of Period was also found in bilateral BF muscles ( p < 0.01) but with increased activation before freezing that was generally sustained during and after FE. Main effects of Period were also found for all measures of variability, except for the least affected GM, showing reduced variability during the FE that returned to baseline in all muscles except both TA. Moreover, an increase in functional connectivity between the least affected distal muscles was seen before the FE. Our findings confirm that many characteristics of EMG patterns of both distal and proximal leg muscles change throughout periods of a FE, suggesting both impairment and adaptive strategies from proximal muscles.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,BioPotential,,EMG,,,,

In this paper, we describe deep learning models for diagnosis/prognosis derived from a few minutes of eyes-closed resting electroencephalography data (EEG) collected at baseline from idiopathic RBD patients ( n = 121) and healthy controls (HC, n = 91). A few years after the EEG acquisition (4Ã‚Â±2 years), a subset of the RBD patients were eventually diagnosed with either PD ( n = 14) or Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), while the rest remained idiopathic RBD. We describe first a simple deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with a five-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG spectrograms from idiopathic patients and healthy controls. We treat the data as in audio or image classification problems where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. For comparison, we study a simple deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model using three stacked Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) cells or gated-recurrent unit (GRU) cellsÃ¢â‚¬â€with very similar results. The performance of these networks typically reaches 80% (Ã‚Â±1%) classification accuracy in the balanced HC vs. PD-conversion classification problem. In particular, using data from the best single EEG channel, we obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 87% (Ã‚Â±1%)Ã¢â‚¬â€while avoiding spectral feature selection. The trained classifier can also be used to generate synthetic spectrograms using the DeepDream algorithm to study what time-frequency features are relevant for classification. We find these to be bursts in the theta band together with a decrease of bursting in the alpha band in future RBD converters (i.e., converting to PD or DLB in the follow up) relative to HCs. From this first study, we conclude that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, offering physiological insights and enabling the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers.",,,Diagnosis,Sleep Topics,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

Current gait assessments mostly focus on straight strides with assumed constant velocity, while acceleration/deceleration and turning strides are often ignored. This is either due to the set up of typical clinical assessments or technical limitations in capture volume. Wearable inertial measurement units are a promising and unobtrusive technology to overcome these limitations. Other gait phases such as initiation, termination, transitioning (between straight walking and turning) and turning might be relevant as well for the evaluation of gait and balance impairments in PD. In a cohort of 119 PD patients, we applied unsupervised algorithms to find different gait clusters which potentially include the clinically relevant information from distinct gait phases in the standardized 4x10 m gait test. To clinically validate our approach, we determined the discriminative power in each gait cluster to classify between impaired and unimpaired PD patients and compared it to baseline (analyzing all straight strides). As a main result, analyzing only one of the gait clusters constant, non-constant or turning led in each case to a better classification performance in comparison to the baseline (increase of area under the curve (AUC) up to 19% relative to baseline). Furthermore, gait parameters (for turning, constant and non-constant gait) that best predict motor impairment in PD were identified. We conclude that a more detailed analysis in terms of different gait clusters of standardized gait tests such as the 4x10 m walk may give more insights about the clinically relevant motor impairment in PD patients.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

We enrolled 50 patients with PD who were randomly assigned to two different modalities of treadmill gait training using GaitTrainer3 with and without RAS (non_RAS) during an 8-week training program. We measured clinical, kinematic, and electrophysiological effects of both the gait trainings. We found a greater improvement in Functional Gait Assessment ( p Ã¢â‚¬â€°<Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale ( p Ã¢â‚¬â€°<Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale ( p Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and overall gait quality index ( p Ã¢â‚¬â€°<Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) following RAS than non_RAS training. In addition, the RAS gait training induced a stronger EEG power increase within the sensorimotor rhythms related to specific periods of the gait cycle, and a greater improvement of fronto-centroparietal/temporal electrode connectivity than the non_RAS gait training. The findings of our study suggest that the usefulness of cueing strategies during gait training consists of a reshape of sensorimotor rhythms and fronto-centroparietal/temporal connectivity. Restoring the internal timing mechanisms that generate and control motor rhythmicity, thus improving gait performance, likely depends on a contribution of the cerebellum. Finally, identifying these mechanisms is crucial to create patient-tailored, RAS-based rehabilitative approaches in PD. NCT03434496 .

Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of walking function recovery is to walk on the ground rather than on the treadmill. This study aims to determine the effect of treadmill walking on gait and upper trunk movement characteristics using wearable sensors. Eight healthy male subjects are recruited to perform 420-m straight overground walking (OW) and 5 min treadmill walking (TW), wearing 3 inertial measurement units and a pair of insole sensors. In addition to common linear features, nonlinear features, which contains sample entropy, maximal Lyapunov exponent and fractal dynamic of stride intervals (detrended fluctuation analysis), are used to compare the difference between TW and OW condition. Canonical correlation analysis is also used to indicate the correlation between upper trunk movement characteristics and gait features in the aspects of spatiotemporal parameters and gait dynamic features. The experimental results show that the treadmill can cause a shorter stride length, less stride time and worsen long-range correlation of stride intervals. And the treadmill can significantly increase the stability for both gait and upper trunk, while it can significantly reduce gait regularity during swing phase. Canonical correlation analysis results show that treadmill can reduce the correlation between gait and upper trunk features. One possible interpretation of these results is that people tend to walk more cautiously to prevent the risk of falling and neglect the coordination between gait and upper trunk when walking on the treadmill.

It results from degeneration of Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc) of the Basal Ganglia (BG). Gait disturbances in PD patients generally get worse over time. The underlying mechanism of gait disturbances in PD has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we tried to analyze changes in walking performance under both single- and dual-task conditions in people with PD compared to healthy subjects. To this end, the participantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ trunk acceleration signals were recorded under dual-task (counting the stride number while walking) and single-task (walking without performing any other secondary tasks) conditions. The healthy subjects counted the number of their strides correctly; however, 85% of the patients made glaring errors in counting. Then variances of Stride Time Interval (STI) signals were calculated for each participant. STI signals of the patients had a higher variance than that of the healthy subjects in the dual-task condition. Separating the two groups in a dual-task condition is easier. Therefore, we think that the disease sate can be detected in early stages. It is thought that counting is performed independent of walking. PD affects the function of BG that leads to motor timing dysfunction. So, it seems that timing in motor tasks is disrupted while timing in cognitive tasks is not. Therefore, perhaps inconsistency between the two clocks (motor-tasks and cognitive-tasks clocks) is the main cause of dual-task interference in patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gait.",>30,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,Research Article,

Purpose: To study whether a semi-quantitative EEG analysis can aid in distinguishing idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) from atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs), and furthermore, whether it can help to distinguish between APDs. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive retrospective review of charts was performed to include patients with parkinsonian disorders who had at least one EEG recording available. A modified grand total EEG (GTE) score evaluating the posterior background activity, and diffuse and focal slow wave activities was used in further analyses. Results: We analyzed data from 76 patients with a final diagnosis of either IPD, probable corticobasal degeneration (CBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), or progressive supra-nuclear palsy (PSP). IPD patients had the lowest mean GTE score, followed those with CBD or MSA, while PSP patients scored the highest. However, none of these differences were statistically significant. A GTE score of Ã¢â€°Â¤9 distinguished IPD patients from those with APD (p < 0.01) with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 33.3%. Conclusion: The modified GTE score can distinguish patients with IPD from those with CBD, PSP or MSA at a cut-off score of 9 with excellent sensitivity but poor specificity. However, this score is not able to distinguish a particular form of APD from other forms of the disorder.",>30,Laboratory,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Cortical Activity,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

This study aims to validate an ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) device for the detection of sleep and wake states and apply it to the evaluation of sleep quality in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). A polysomnographic validation study was conducted on a group of patients with different sleep disorders in a preliminary phase, followed by a pilot study to apply this methodology to PD patients. The ACM device makes it possible to estimate the main sleep parameters very accurately, as demonstrated by: (a) the lack of significant differences between the mean values detected by PSG and ACM in time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and time awake after sleep onset (WASO); (b) the slope of the correlation lines between the parameters estimated by the two procedures, very close to 1, which demonstrates the linearity of the predictions; (c) the low bias value in the estimates obtained through ACM. Sleep in PD is associated with lower distal skin temperature, efficiency and overall sleep time; greater WASO, activity during sleep and duration of naps and a worse circadian function index. In summary, the ACM device has proven to be clinically useful to evaluate sleep in an objective manner, thanks to the integrated management of different complementary variables, having advantages over conventional actigraphy.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Sleep Topics,Wearable,,"Accelerometer, Temp Sensor, Light Sensors",,,,
Identification of Motor Symptoms Related to Parkinson Disease Using Motion-Tracking Sensors at Home (KÃƒâ€žVELI): Protocol for an Observational Case-Control Study,,2019,JMIR Research Protocols,"Parkinson disease,movement analysis,gait,wearable sensors,smartphone,home monitoring,mobile phone","Clinical characterization of motion in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) is challenging: symptom progression, suitability of medication, and level of independence in the home environment can vary across time and patients. Appointments at the neurological outpatient clinic provide a limited understanding of the overall situation. In order to follow up these variations, longer-term measurements performed outside of the clinic setting could help optimize and personalize therapies. Several wearable sensors have been used to estimate the severity of symptoms in PD; however, longitudinal recordings, even for a short duration of a few days, are rare. Home recordings have the potential benefit of providing a more thorough and objective follow-up of the disease while providing more information about the possible need to change medications or consider invasive treatments. The primary objective of this study is to collect a dataset for developing methods to detect PD-related symptoms that are visible in walking patterns at home. The movement data are collected continuously and remotely at home during the normal lives of patients with PD as well as controls. The secondary objective is to use the dataset to study whether the registered medication intakes can be identified from the collected movement data by looking for and analyzing short-term changes in walking patterns. This paper described the protocol for an observational case-control study that measures activity using three different devices: (1) a smartphone with a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and phone orientation sensor, (2) a Movesense smart sensor to measure movement data from the wrist, and (3) a Forciot smart insole to measure the forces applied on the feet. The measurements are first collected during the appointment at the clinic conducted by a trained clinical physiotherapist. Subsequently, the subjects wear the smartphone at home for 3 consecutive days. Wrist and insole sensors are not used in the home recordings. Data collection began in March 2018. Subject recruitment and data collection will continue in spring 2019. The intended sample size was 150 subjects. In 2018, we collected a sample of 103 subjects, 66 of whom were diagnosed with PD. This study aims to produce an extensive movement-sensor dataset recorded from patients with PD in various phases of the disease as well as from a group of control subjects for effective and impactful comparison studies. The study also aims to develop data analysis methods to monitor PD symptoms and the effects of medication intake during normal life and outside of the clinic setting. Further applications of these methods may include using them as tools for health care professionals to monitor PD remotely and applying them to other movement disorders.

"Remnants of Cardinal Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, Not Dyskinesia, Are Problematic for Dyskinetic Patients Performing Activities of Daily Living","Goubault, Etienne; Nguyen, Hung P.; Bogard, Sarah; Blanchet, Pierre J.; BÃƒÂ©zard, Erwan; Vincent, Claude; Sarna, Justyna; Monchi, Oury; Duval, Christian",2019,Frontiers in Neurology,"Parkinson disease,levodopa-induced dyskinesia,activities of daily living,motor performance,cardinal symptoms","Introduction: The impact of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) on the daily lives of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be determined. Furthermore, evidence suggests that cardinal motor symptoms of PD may coexist with LID, but their impact on activities of daily living (ADL) relative to LID is not known. This cross-sectional study aimed at determining the effect of LID and cardinal motor symptoms of PD on ADL in patients who were experiencing peak-dose choreic-type LID. Method: One hundred and twenty-one patients diagnosed with PD known to experience choreic-type LID were recruited for the study. Patients were asked to perform a set of ADL. Levels of LID, tremor, bradykinesia, and Freezing of gait (FoG) were measured using 17 inertial sensors design to capture full body movements, while rigidity, and postural instability were assessed using clinical evaluations. Cognition was also assessed using the mini-mental state examination. Success criteria were set for each ADL using the time needed to perform the task and errors measured in 69 age-gender-matched healthy controls. Binary logistic regressions were used to identify symptoms influencing success or failure for each activity. Receiver operating characteristic curves were computed on each significant symptom, and Youden indexes were calculated to determine the critical level of symptomatology at which the performance significantly changed. Results: Results show that 97.7% of patients who presented with LID during the experiment also presented with at least one cardinal motor symptom. On average, patients took more time and did more errors during ADL. Multivariate analyses revealed that for the great majority of ADL, LID were not associated with worsening of performance; however, postural instability, tremor, rigidity, and cognitive decline significantly decreased the odds of success. Conclusions: Residual symptoms of PD, such as tremor, rigidity, and postural instability still present at peak-dose were more problematic than LID in the performance of ADL for patients experiencing slight-to-moderate LID. We also found that cognitive decline was associated with decreased performance in certain tasks. Therefore, a strategy using lower doses of medication to manage LID may be counterproductive since it would not address most of these symptoms already present in patients.",>30,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,IMU,,,,
The Diagnostic Scope of Sensor-Based Gait Analysis in Atypical Parkinsonism: Further Observations,"GaÃƒÅ¸ner, Heiko; Raccagni, Cecilia; Eskofier, Bjoern M.; Klucken, Jochen; Wenning, Gregor K.",2019,Frontiers in Neurology,"neurologic gait disorders,postural balance,biosensors,Parkinson disease,progressive supranuclear palsy,multisystem atrophy,gait analysis","Background: Differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) from atypical Parkinsonian disorders (APD) is challenging, especially in early disease stages. Postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) are substantial motor impairments of IPD and APD. Clinical evidence implies that patients with APD have larger PIGD impairment than IPD patients. Sensor-based gait analysis as instrumented bedside test revealed more gait deficits in APD compared to IPD. However, the diagnostic value of instrumented bedside tests compared to clinical assessments in differentiating APD from IPD patients have not been evaluated so far. Objective: The objectives were (a) to evaluate whether sensor-based gait parameters provide additional information to validated clinical scores in differentiating APD from matched IPD patients, and (b) to investigate if objective, instrumented gait assessments have comparable discriminative power to clinical scores. Methods: In a previous study we have recorded instrumented gait parameters in patients with APD (Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy). Here, we compared gait parameters to those of retrospectively pairwise disease duration-, age-, and gender-matched IPD patients in order to address this new research questions. To this aim, the PIGD score was calculated as sum of the MDS-UPDRS-3-items Ã¢â‚¬Å“gait,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“postural stability,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“arising from chair,Ã¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“posture.Ã¢â‚¬Â Gait characteristics were evaluated in standardized gait tests using an instrumented, sensor-based gait analysis system. Machine learning algorithms were used to extract spatio-temporal gait parameters. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was performed in order to detect the discriminative power of the instrumented vs. the clinical bedside tests in differentiating IPD from APD. Results: Sensor-based stride length, gait velocity, toe off angle, and parameters representing gait variability significantly differed between IPD and APD groups. ROC analysis revealed a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) for PIGD score (0.919), and UPDRS-3 (0.848). Particularly, the objective parameters stance time variability (0.841), swing time variability (0.834), stride time variability (0.821), and stride length variability (0.804) reached high AUC's as well. Conclusions: PIGD symptoms showed high discriminative power in differentiating IPD from APD supporting gait disorders as substantial diagnostic target. Sensor-based gait variability parameters provide metric, objective added value, and serve as complementary outcomes supporting clinical diagnostics and long-term home-monitoring concepts.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait, Posture, Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia",Wearable,IMU,,,,,
Less Is More Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Estimation of the Number of Strides Required to Assess Gait Variability in Spatially Confined Settings,"Kroneberg, Daniel; Elshehabi, Morad; Meyer, Anne-Christiane; Otte, Karen; Doss, Sarah; Paul, Friedemann; Nussbaum, Susanne; Berg, Daniela; KÃƒÂ¼hn, Andrea A.; Maetzler, Walter; Schmitz-HÃƒÂ¼bsch, Tanja",2019,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,"gait variability,gait analysis,turn detection,healthy elderly,movement disorders","Background: Gait variability is an established marker of gait function that can be assessed using sensor-based approaches. In clinical settings, spatial constraints and patient condition impede the execution of longer distance walks for the recording of gait parameters. Turning paradigms are often used to overcome these constraints and commercial gait analysis systems algorithmically exclude turns for gait parameters calculations. We investigated the effect of turns in sensor-based assessment of gait variability. Methods: Continuous recordings from 31 patients with movement disorders (ataxia, essential tremor and ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease) and 162 healthy elderly (HE) performing level walks including 180Ã‚Â° turns were obtained using an inertial sensor system. Accuracy of the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s algorithm of turn-detection was verified by plotting stride time series. Strides before and after turn events were extracted and compared to respective average of all strides. Coefficient of variation (CoV) of stride length and stride time was calculated for entire set of strides, segments between turns and as cumulative values. Their variance and congruency was used to estimate the number of strides required to reliably assess the magnitude of stride variability. Results: Non-detection of turns in 5.8% of HE lead to falsely increased CoV for these individuals. Even after exclusion of these, strides before/after turns tended to be spatially shorter and temporally longer in all groups, contributing to an increase of CoV at group level and widening of confidence margins with increasing numbers of strides. This could be attenuated by a more generous turn excision as an alternative approach. Correlation analyses revealed excellent consistency for CoVs after at most 20 strides in all groups. Respective stride counts were even lower in patients using a more generous turn excision. Conclusion: Including turns to increase continuous walking distance in spatially confined settings does not necessarily improve the validity and reliability of gait variability measures. Specifically with gait pathology, perturbations of stride characteristics before/after algorithmically excised turns were observed that may increase gait variability with this paradigm. We conclude that shorter distance walks of around 15 strides suffice for reliable and valid recordings of gait variability in the groups studied here.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait, Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia",Wearable,IMU,,,,,

A classification engine assigns subjects to healthy or Parkinsonian classes. The diagnosis process involves four steps: data pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, data classification and performance evaluation. The selected features are used as inputs of each classifier. Feature selection is achieved through a wrapper approach established using the random forest algorithm. The proposed methodology uses both supervised classification methods including K-nearest neighbour (K-NN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and unsupervised classification methods such as K-means and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an online dataset collected within three different studies is used. This data set includes vGRF measurements collected from eight force sensors placed under each foot of the subjects. Ninety-three patients suffering from ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease and 72 healthy subjects participated in the experiments. The obtained performances are compared with respect to various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure. The classification performance evaluation is performed using the leave-one-out cross validation. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed methodology to accurately differentiate between PD subjects and healthy subjects. For the purpose of validation, the proposed methodology is also evaluated with an additional dataset including subjects with neurodegenerative diseases (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and HuntingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease (HD)). The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to discriminate PD subjects from subjects with other neurodegenerative diseases with a relatively high accuracy.",>30,,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Force Sensors,,,,

Detection and early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease are essential in terms of disease progression and treatment process. Parkinson's disease dataset used in this study was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The proposed hybrid machine learning method consists of two stages: i) data pre-processing (over-sampling), ii) classification. The Parkinson's disease dataset (PD dataset) is a two-class dataset. While 192 data belong to normal (healthy) individuals, 564 data belong to the diseased class (PD). The data set has an imbalanced class distribution. To transform this imbalanced dataset to balanced dataset, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) method is used. Then, after converting to a balanced class distribution, Random Forests classification method was used for classification of Parkinson's disease dataset. The PD dataset consists of 753 attributes. Only the random forests classification were classified as 87.037% in the classification of PD dataset, while the proposed hybrid method (the combination of SMOTE and random forests) achieved 94.89% classification success.

In this work, the Freezing of gait (FoG) from subjects with Parkinson disease has been detected by the logistic regression modeling. To complete this work, first, the acceleration sensor has been placed on the ankle of the patients to get the signals. Second, the features from these acceleration signals have been extracted by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. With the FFT algorithm, the frequency coefficients have been gotten. To diminish the number of features, the statistical measures including variance, maximum amplitude, minimum amplitude, maximum energy, and minimum energy, have been applied to frequency coefficients of these signals. So, for each class (FoG and no- FoG), five parameters have been extracted. Eight patients are having Parkinson disease in the dataset. After feature extraction, the logistic regression modeling has been used to detect the Freezing of gait cases from the dataset. The classification of the accuracy of 81.3% has been achieved in the classification of FoG cases having PD from the acceleration signals. In addition to logistic regression, four different classifiers (Linear SVM, Quadratic SVM, Cubic SVM, and kNN) have been used to classify the FoG cases.

We selected a robust subset of 30 dysphonia measures using Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO). We projected the data onto a two-dimensional representation using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to facilitate visual exploration, and used hierarchical clustering to understand data homogeneity. We demonstrate that there is considerable overlap in the projected feature space between PD and HC, making the binary classification task particularly challenging. The data was grouped into nine clusters using hierarchical clustering which was in broad agreement with the projected two-dimensional representation.

As the amount of dopamine decreases, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease emerge. Parkinson's disease is a slow-developing disease, and symptoms such as hands, arms, legs, chin and face tremors are increasing over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty in walking and speaking. There is no definitive treatment for Parkinson's disease; however, with the help of some drugs, the symptoms of the disease can be reduced. Although there is no definitive treatment for Parkinson's disease, the patient can continue his normal life by controlling the problems caused by the disease. At this point, it is important to prevent early detection and progression of the disease. In this study, different types of classification methods such as Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest are compared in order to predict Parkinson's disease. A total of 1208 speech data sets consisting of 26 features obtained from Parkinson's patients and non-patients were used in the classification stage. The feature space of the dataset is expanded due to correlation maps. These correlation maps are constructed with the features which are obtained by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Information Gain (IG) and all features respectively.

Sain,2019,2019 21st International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT),ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease;machine learning;feature selection;voice data;genetic algorithm,"Among the neurological diseases, parkinson's disease is the second most common disease, which affect the old age people over the age of 65 year. It is also mentioned that the number of people affected with Parkinson's disease will increase at a higher rate until 2050, and it will be a rising concern to many developed countries because the cost due to the healthcare service of these disease is really high. Parkinson's disease (PD) belongs to the group of neurological disorder, which directly affect the brain cells and the effect is shown in terms of movement, voice and other cognitive disabilities. Past few years researchers are working for detection and monitoring of the Parkinson's disease by using the speech analysis as well as the gait analysis data. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques are gaining popularity because these techniques are able to automate the pattern recognition process with high accuracy.However so far, no body has compared the performance metrics using different feature sets by applying nonlinear and linear classification approaches based on the voice data. So, in this paper we have proposed a new approach by comparing the performance metrics with different feature sets such as genetic algorithm-based feature sets as well as Principal Component Analysis based feature reduction technique for selecting the feature sets. We have used different classification approaches to compare the performance metrics. We have found an accuracy of 97.57% using SVM with RBF by using genetic algorithm-based feature sets. This analysis will help the clinicians to differentiate the PD group from healthy group based on the voice data.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,
Diagnosis of The Parkinson Disease Using Enhanced Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network and OneR Attribute Evaluation Method,O. N. Al Sayaydeha; M. F. Mohammad,2019,2019 International Conference on Advanced Science and Engineering (ICOASE),fuzzy min-max;pattern classification;fuzzy neural network;parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease is a dangerous disease that attacks the nervous system and affects it negatively over time. Early diagnosis of this disease is necessary for identifying the most appropriate treatment for preventing the disease from worsening. It can be diagnosed by examining the symptoms of the patient. Recently, researchers have used voice disorders to diagnose Parkinson's disease by extracting attributes from audio recordings of affected people and using classification techniques to provide accurate diagnoses. In this paper, an enhanced fuzzy minmax neural network with the OneR attribute evaluator (EFMM-OneR) is proposed as a hybrid model for diagnosing Parkinson's disease. The proposed model consists of two stages: In the first stage, feature selection is used to identify and remove irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features from the provided dataset. In the second stage, the enhanced fuzzy min-max (EFMM) neural network is used for the classification process. The results demonstrated the ability of the EFMM-OneR model to improve the classification accuracy as compared to other classifiers from the literature.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,

A database is introduced, which contains speech samples uttered by Hungarian Parkinson patients and healthy control population. Classification and regression models are built using various machine-learning methods for all speech tasks separately. Additional to the separate decisions for all speech tasks, a joint decision was made for each speaker. The final prediction was obtained by fusing the separate estimations for each speaker. Test trials were run in order to investigate, if age is a relevant feature for the machine learning tasks. The best results were obtained using support vector machine with 89.3% accuracy for binary classification. With regression, the method achieved 0.787 Spearman correlation for Parkinson severity level estimation measured on Hoehn-Yahr scale. Performance measures slightly varied according to gender differences.

NÃƒÂ¶th,2019,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Parkinson's disease;deep learning;convolutional neural networks;speech;handwriting;gait,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of motor symptoms. Particularly, difficulties to start/stop movements have been observed in patients. From a technical/diagnostic point of view, these movement changes can be assessed by modeling the transitions between voiced and unvoiced segments in speech, the movement when the patient starts or stops a new stroke in handwriting, or the movement when the patient starts or stops the walking process. This study proposes a methodology to model such difficulties to start or to stop movements considering information from speech, handwriting, and gait. We used those transitions to train convolutional neural networks to classify patients and healthy subjects. The neurological state of the patients was also evaluated according to different stages of the disease (initial, intermediate, and advanced). In addition, we evaluated the robustness of the proposed approach when considering speech signals in three different languages: Spanish, German, and Czech. According to the results, the fusion of information from the three modalities is highly accurate to classify patients and healthy subjects, and it shows to be suitable to assess the neurological state of the patients in several stages of the disease. We also aimed to interpret the feature maps obtained from the deep learning architectures with respect to the presence or absence of the disease and the neurological state of the patients.

Deep Learning-Based ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease Classification Using Vocal Feature Sets,H. Gunduz,2019,IEEE Access,Convolutional neural networks;deep learning;health informatics;ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease classification;vocal features,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with multiple motor and non-motor characteristics. PD patients commonly face vocal impairments during the early stages of the disease. So, diagnosis systems based on vocal disorders are at the forefront on recent PD detection studies. Our study proposes two frameworks based on Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Parkinson's Disease (PD) using sets of vocal (speech) features. Although, both frameworks are employed for the combination of various feature sets, they have difference in terms of combining feature sets. While the first framework combines different feature sets before given to 9-layered CNN as inputs, whereas the second framework passes feature sets to the parallel input layers which are directly connected to convolution layers. Thus, deep features from each parallel branch are extracted simultaneously before combining in the merge layer. Proposed models are trained with dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning repository and their performances are validated with Leave-One-Person-Out Cross Validation (LOPO CV). Due to imbalanced class distribution in our data, F-Measure and Matthews Correlation Coefficient metrics are used for the assessment along with accuracy. Experimental results show that the second framework seems to be very promising, since it is able to learn deep features from each feature set via parallel convolution layers. Extracted deep features are not only successful at distinguishing PD patients from healthy individuals but also effective in boosting up the discriminative power of the classifiers.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,

This disorder affects around 2% of elderly population. In Colombia, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease is around 172 cases per 100.000 inhabitants. Furthermore, around 89% of people diagnosed with PD also suffer from speech disorders. This has motivated many advances in speech signal processing for PD patients which allows to perform assisted diagnosis and also monitor the progression of the disease. In this paper, we propose to use slow varying information from speech signals, also known as modulation components, and combine it with an approach to effectively reduce the number of features to be used in a classification system. The proposed approach achieves around 90% accuracy, outperforming the classical mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) approach.

Andrade,2019,2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),Postural tremor;ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease;Non-contact capacitive sensor;Frequency analysis,"Parkinsonian tremor manifests in different types: rest, postural, and action tremors. The postural tremor occurs while a body part is held straight out from the body in a stable position against gravity. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which is a subjective assessment performed by the qualitative judgment of neurologists, is the clinical standard for parkinsonian tremor assessment. Despite the common use of subjective methods, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are largely used in many studies as a motion capture system to objective assessment of tremors. However, this kind of sensor must be attached to the patient's body, it limits the patient's movements and requires specific techniques for correct positioning in the limb. In this sense, non-contact capacitive (NCC) sensors are an alternative proposed in this research to record the motor activity of the hand and wrist during a pose against gravity. In order to assess the postural tremor and evaluate this novel sensing technology, data from ten subjects, five with Parkinson's disease (PD) and five neurologically healthy (H) matched in age and sex, were collected. We analyzed the instantaneous mean frequency (IMNF) of the signals from NCC and gyroscope sensors for both groups. The selected descriptive statistical variables allowed discrimination (p <; 0.05) among subjects from H and PD groups while using the gyroscope or the NCC sensor. The obtained results indicate that the NCC sensor can measure the postural hand tremor, and also that frequency features extracted from the collected signals can be used to discriminate subjects from both groups.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor,Wearable,,"Non-contact capacitive sensors, Gyroscope",,,,

Since the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is difficult, researchers have worked to develop a support tool based on algorithms to separate healthy controls from PD patients. Online handwriting dynamic signals can provide more detailed and complex information for PD detection task. Existing techniques often depended on hand-crafted features that required expert knowledge of the field. In this paper, it is suggested to learn pen-based features by means of deep learning for automatic classification of PD. For this purpose, a visual representation of the time series can be computed and used at the input of a convolutional neural network (CNN) as in [4]. Classically, the time series is transformed into a fixed dimension image applying normalization on the time dimension. In this work we have experimented several visual representations, including the spectrogram where normalization of the time scale is applied after short term information has been extracted locally. We have been able to show that considering the local short term information allows the deep learning models to provide better classification results compared to a globally normalized fixed dimension visual representation. For validation purpose, a CNN-BLSTM was directly applied on the time series, without any normalization of the time scale which led to best performance equivalent to the one obtained on spectrogram representation.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Other,,"SmartPen (X,Y,Z accelerations, pressure, altitude, azimuth)",,,,

Digitized handwritten pattern analysis of Archimedes' spirals, words, and sentences can help evaluate movement discords in the upper limbs. It offers a simple, comfortable, and repeatable method of examination for clinical applications and at-home monitoring usages. Upper limb tremors can be found in PD, essential tremor (ET), and cerebellar disorders. This paper proposes a quantitative method to scale the variations of functional tremors. The deviation (in cm) and the accumulation angle (in rad) of the feature pattern in polar expression were extracted to scale the variability at different tremor levels. Then, the proposed intelligent classifier, which is used as a perceptual color representation-based classifier (PCRC) and comprises a radial Bayesian network and a color relation analysis method, was employed to screen PD or ET with perceptual color representation. An assistant tool can integrate a smart mobile device (iPad/smartphone) and PCRC into the decision support system for individualized functions to evaluate the progression of the tremor level. The proposed decision support system was validated using data collected from 50 subjects. With fivefold cross-validation, average true positive, average true negative, and hit rates of 92.02%, 88.17% and 90.44%, respectively, were obtained to quantify the performance of the proposed classifier for identifying normal controls and PD or ET.",,,Diagnosis,Tremor,Smartphone,,,,,,
Automated Detection of ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease Based on Multiple Types of Sustained Phonations Using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Genetically Optimized Neural Network,L. Ali; C. Zhu; Z. Zhang; Y. Liu,2019,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,Dimensionality reduction;genetic algorithm;hyper-parameter optimization;linear discriminant analysis;ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease;deep neural network,"Objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder. It is reported that most of PD patients have voice impairments. But these voice impairments are not perceptible to common listeners. Therefore, different machine learning methods have been developed for automated PD detection. However, these methods either lack generalization and clinically significant classification performance or face the problem of subject overlap. Methods: To overcome the problems discussed above, we attempt to develop a hybrid intelligent system that can automatically perform acoustic analysis of voice signals in order to detect PD. The proposed intelligent system uses linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and genetic algorithm (GA) for hyperparameters optimization of neural network (NN) which is used as a predictive model. Moreover, to avoid subject overlap, we use leave one subject out (LOSO) validation. Results: The proposed method namely LDA-NN-GA is evaluated in numerical experiments on multiple types of sustained phonations data in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthew correlation coefficient. It achieves classification accuracy of 95% on training database and 100% on testing database using all the extracted features. However, as the dataset is imbalanced in terms of gender, thus, to obtain unbiased results, we eliminated the gender dependent features and obtained accuracy of 80% for training database and 82.14% for testing database, which seems to be more unbiased results. Conclusion: Compared with the previous machine learning methods, the proposed LDA-NN-GA method shows better performance and lower complexity. Clinical Impact: The experimental results suggest that the proposed automated diagnostic system has the potential to classify PD patients from healthy subjects. Additionally, in future the proposed method can also be exploited for prodromal and differential diagnosis, which are considered challenging tasks.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

When compared to popular types of linear regression (OLS and LASSO), the nonlinear models fit their data better and generalize to unseen data significantly better. It was found that models developed for healthy control subjects generalized to other control subjects well, however the models trained on subjects with PD did not generalize well to other PD patients, which complicates the issue of being able to detect the progression of the disease. It is suspected that health care professionals can have difficulty classifying PD due to a lack of accurate data from patient reports; having individually trained models for active monitoring of patients would help in effectively diagnosing PD.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Pressure sensor,,,,

Jimenez-Shahed,2019,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Parkinsons disease;activities of daily living dynamics;sensor fusion;time-frequency analysis;tensor decomposition;pattern classification,"Motor fluctuations are a frequent complication in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) where the response to medication fluctuates between ON states (medication working) and OFF states (medication has worn off). This paper describes a new data analysis approach that can be used along with two wearable IMU (inertial measurement units) sensors to continuously assess motor fluctuations in PD patients while moving in their natural environment. We hypothesized that joint analysis of the sensor data in its spectral, temporal and sensor domain could generate multilevel features that can be used to detect PD-related patterns successfully as the subject's motor state fluctuates between medication ON and OFF states. For this purpose, we utilized time-frequency (TF) representation and multiway data analysis tools (i.e., tensor decomposition) to decompose the TF representation of the two sensors' data into its multilevel structures, which were next used to extract multilevel features representing the PD symptoms in different medication states. The extracted multilevel features were used in a classification model based on support vector machine to detect medication ON and OFF states. For comparison purposes, we implemented a traditional feature extraction method. We also developed a hierarchical feature extraction method based on the combination of those two methods. The performances of the three methods were evaluated using a dataset of 19 PD subjects with a total duration of 17.54 hours. The multilevel features achieved 8.25% improvement in the accuracy over the traditional features, and the hierarchical features resulted in 10.73% improvement indicating that our approach holds great promise to continuously detect medication states from continuous monitoring of the subjects' movement. Such information can be used by the treating physician to tailor the adjustments to each subject's unique impairment(s), thereby improving therapeutic decision-making and patient outcomes.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

This system uses the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) for hand tracking and the Oculus Rift for a fully immersive experience. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the capabilities of our VR-BBT to reliably measure the manual dexterity in a sample of PD patients. For this study, a group of nine individuals in mild to moderate stage of PD were recruited. Participants were asked to perform both the physical BBT and the VR-BBT systems. Correlation analysis of collected data was carried out comparing the BBT and VR-BBT assessments. The test-retest reliability was also explored for the scores gathered with the virtual tool. Statistical analysis proved that the performance data collected by the game-like system correlated with the validated measures of the physical BBT, with a strong test-retest reliability.

Missing data has shown particularly problematic for remotely diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) using smartphones. This contribution presents multi-source ensemble learning, a methodology which combines dataset deconstruction with ensemble learning and enables participants with incomplete data (i.e., where not all sensor data is available) to be included in the training of machine learning models and achieves a 100% participant retention rate. We demonstrate the proposed method on a cohort of 1513 participants, 91.2% of which contributed incomplete data in tapping, gait, voice, and/or memory tests. The use of multi-source ensemble learning, alongside convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capitalizing on the amount of available data, increases PD classification accuracy from 73.1% to 82.0% as compared to traditional techniques. The increase in accuracy is found to be partly caused by the use of multi-channel CNNs and partly caused by developing models using the large cohort of participants. Furthermore, through bootstrap sampling we reveal that feature selection is better performed on a large cohort of participants with incomplete data than on a small number of participants with complete data. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of wearable/remote monitoring datasets that suffer from missing data and contributes to improving the ability to remotely monitor PD via revealing novel methods of accounting for symptom heterogeneity.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,,Wearable/audio,,,,,,Also Diagnosis

In this context, Parkinsons Disease (PD) has received particular attention in that it is a severe and progressive neurodegenerative disease and, therefore, early diagnosis would provide more prompt and effective intervention strategies. This, in turn, would successfully influence the life expectancy of the patients. However, the acceptance of computer-based diagnosis by doctors is hampered by the black-box approach implemented by the most performing systems, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, which do not explicit the rules adopted by the system. In this context, we propose a Cartesian Genetic Programming, aimed at automatically identify PD through the analysis of handwriting performed by PD patients and healthy controls. The use of such approach is particularly interesting in that it allows to infer explicit models of classification and, at same time, to automatically identify a suitable subset of features relevant for a correct diagnosis. The approach has been evaluated on the features extracted from the handwriting samples contained in the publicly available PaHaW dataset.

Efficient and early prediction of people having PD is a key issue to improve patient's quality of life. The diagnosis of PD specifically in its initial stages is extremely complex and time-consuming. Thus, the accurate and efficient diagnosis of PD has been a significant challenge for medical experts and practitioners. In order to tackle this issue and to accurately diagnosis the patient of PD, we proposed a machine-learning-based prediction system. In the development of the proposed system, the support vector machine (SVM) was used as a predictive model for the prediction of PD. The L1-norm SVM of features selection was used for appropriate and highly related features selection for accurate target classification of PD and healthy people. The L1-norm SVM produced a new subset of features from the PD dataset based on a feature weight value. For the validation of the proposed system, the K-fold cross-validation method was used. In addition, the metrics of performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and execution time, were computed for model performance evaluation. The PD dataset was in this paper. The optimal accuracy achieved the best subset of the selected features that might be due to various contributions of the PD features. The experimental findings of this paper suggest that the proposed method can be used to accurately predict the PD and can be easily incorporated in healthcare for diagnosis purpose. Currently, the computer-based assisted predictive system is playing an important role to assist in PD recognition.

Liu,2019,IEEE Access,Balanced accuracy;machine learning;oversampling;ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease;undersampling,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Till now, there is no definitive clinical examination that can diagnose a PD patient. However, it has been reported that PD patients face deterioration in handwriting. Hence, different computer vision and machine learning researchers have proposed micrography and computer vision based methods. But, these methods possess two main problems. The first problem is biasedness in models caused by imbalanced data i.e. machine learning models show good performance on majority class but poor performance on minority class. Unfortunately, previous studies neither discussed this problem nor took any measures to avoid it. In order to highlight the biasedness in the constructed models and practically demonstrate it, we develop four different machine learning models. To alleviate the problem of biasedness, we propose to use random undersampling method to balance the training process. The second problem is low rate of classification accuracy which has limited clinical significance. To improve the PD detection accuracy, we propose a cascaded learning system that cascades a Chi2 model with adaptive boosting (Adaboost) model. The Chi2 model ranks and selects a subset of relevant features from the feature space while Adaboost model is used to predict PD based on the subset of features. Experimental results confirm that the proposed cascaded system shows better performance than other six similar cascaded systems that used six different state of the art machine learning models. Moreover, it was also observed that the proposed cascaded system improves the strength of conventional Adaboost model by 3.3% and reduces its complexity. Additionally, the cascaded system achieved classification accuracy of 76.44%, sensitivity of 70.94% and specificity of 81.94%.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Images,,,,,,

Nowadays tablet computer equipped with stylus pen allows collecting kinematic and pressure parameters describing aspects of the test invisible to the naked eye. In spite of the recent achievements in the digitisation of fine motor tests, very few attention was paid to the parameters of the tests itself.

Kluge,2019,2019 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI),gait analysis;inertial sensors;harmonics;Parkinson's disease,"Sensor-based gait analysis is a valuable tool in diagnosis and assessment of Parkinson's disease. Especially for large data sets, efficient analysis pipelines are required. Pre-segmentation of long time series into chunks of interest is a possible approach to increase efficiency. Therefore, we developed an unsupervised algorithm for the detection of gait sequences from continuous sensor signals. In the proposed method, gyroscope signals representing the angular rate of the feet are analyzed in the frequency domain using moving windows. A gait sequence was detected, if the frequency spectrum of a given window contained harmonic frequencies. The approach was tested on two data sets that differed in the ratio of clinical gait and cyclic movement tests. Sensitivity in both data sets was higher than 99% in a stride-to-stride comparison with ground truth. The specificity was measured with 76.1% (data set 1) and 94.5% (data set 2) for tests against sequences of other cyclic movements. In conclusion, the algorithm offers a reliable and efficient approach for the detection of gait sequences in time series data and is also promising for the application in long-term home-monitoring scenarios.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,IMU,,,,
Prediction of Freezing of gait in ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease Using Statistical Inference and LowerÃ¢â‚¬â€œLimb Acceleration Data,N. Naghavi; E.

Over the last decade, a significant amount of studies has been focused on detecting FoG episodes in clinical and home environments. Yet, there remains a paucity of techniques regarding real-time prediction of FoG before its occurrence. In this paper, a new algorithm was employed to define the best combination of sensor position, axis, sampling window length, and features to predict FoG. We hypothesized that gait deterioration before FoG onsets can be discriminated from normal gait using statistical analysis of features from successive windows of data collected from lower-limb accelerometers. We defined a new performance measure, Ã¢â‚¬Å“predictivityÃ¢â‚¬Â, to compare the number of correctly predicted FoG events among different combinations. We characterized the system performance using data from 10 PD patients, who experienced FoG while performing several walking tasks in a lab environment. The analysis of 120 different combinations revealed that prediction of FoG can be realized by using an individual shank sensor and sample entropy calculated from the horizontal forward axis with window length of 2 s (88.8%, 92.5%, and 89.0% for average predictivity, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively).",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

However, different people experience different symptoms and different levels of severity of PD. This paper proposes a multimodal approach combining voice and image test to enhance the reliability of detecting PD patients. To substantiate this idea, we have evaluated both voice and spiral test data using various machine learning models. The results based on the two types of dataset demonstrate an excellent level of accuracy for PD identification. Pairwise correlation and k-means clustering techniques are used to extract features from the vocal dataset. In this classification problem, the highest accuracy of 95.89% is obtained using an ensemble of 3 classification models. The Pearson's correlation is used to extract features from the image dataset. The best accuracy of 99.6% is achieved using the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). An accuracy of 98.8% and 94.9% are achieved using the Logistic Regression classifier and the Adaptive Boosting classifier on the Static Spiral Test (SST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP), respectively. A second ensemble making use of results from DST, SST, and STCP will provide the overall result of the spiral test. We also implement the multi-modal approach into a touch-enabled smartphone-based application to carry out preliminary PD tests conveniently, without the need of supervision of additional medical personnel or any specialized equipment.

Identifying segments of the signal that adhere to the protocol assumptions is typically performed manually by experts. This process is costly, time consuming, and often infeasible for large-scale data sets. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify the segments of signals that violate the test protocol with a high accuracy. In our approach, the signal is first split into variable duration segments by fitting an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) to the frames of the signals in the mel-frequency cepstral domain. The complexity of the iHMM is capable of growing jointly with the data allowing us to infer a potentially large (asymptotically infinite) number of different phenomena segmented into different hidden states. Then, we identify the segments that adhere to the test protocol by applying a multinomial naive Bayes classifier to the state indicators of segments. The experimental results show that even by using a small amount of training data, we can achieve around 96% accuracy in identifying short-term protocol violations with a 0.2 s resolution.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

These patients benefit from wearable FoG detection systems that provide timely biofeedback cues and hence help them regain control over their gait. Unfortunately, the systems proposed thus far are bulky and obtrusive when worn. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the first integration of an FoG detection system into a single sensor node. To achieve such an integration, features with low computational load are selected and dedicated hardware is designed that limits area and memory utilization. Classification is achieved with a neural network that is capable of learning in real time and thus allows the system to adapt to a patient during runtime. A small form factor FPGA implements the feature extraction and classification, whereas a custom PCB integrates the system into a single node. The system fits into a 4.5 Ãƒâ€” 3.5 Ãƒâ€” 1.5 cm3 housing case, weighs 32 g, and achieves 95.6% sensitivity and 90.2% specificity when adapted to a patient. Biofeedback cues are provided either through auditory or somatosensory means and the system can remain operational for longer than 9 h while providing cues.

The majority of PD patients is associated with handwriting abnormalities called PD dysgraphia, which is linked with rigidity and bradykinesia of muscles involved in the handwriting process. One of the effective approaches of quantitative PD dysgraphia analysis is based on online handwriting processing. In the frame of this study we aim to deeply evaluate and optimize advanced PD handwriting quantification based on fractional order derivatives (FD). For this purpose, we used 37 PD patients and 38 healthy controls from the PaHaW (PD handwriting database). The FD based features were employed in classification and regression analysis (using gradient boosted trees), and evaluated in terms of their discrimination power and abilities to assess severity of PD. The results suggest that the most discriminative and descriptive information provide FD based features extracted from a repetitive loop task or a sentence copy task (maximum sensitivity/specificity = 76 %, error in severity assessment = 14 %, error in PD duration estimation = 22 %). Next, we identified two optimal ranges for the order of fractional derivative, ÃŽÂ± = 0.05-0.45 and ÃŽÂ± = 0.65-0.80. Finally, we observed that inclusion of pressure, azimuth, and tilt together with kinematic features into mathematical modeling has no influence (positive or negative) on classification performance, however, there was a notable improvement in the estimation of PD duration.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Images,,,,,,

This study aims to a deeper insight into pathophysiological mechanisms associated with balance disorders in PD patients, under and not under dopaminergic treatment, through muscle synergy analysis. Ten patients with PD and ten age-matched healthy subjects were exposed to external perturbations around the vertical axis (yaw perturbations). PD patients were evaluated twice, both under their usual dopaminergic therapy (ON) and after a medication washout period of 12 hours (OFF). Two different external perturbations were provided using the RotoBit1D. Muscle activities of 12 bilateral muscles of the upper body were gathered through surface electromyography. To extract muscles synergies, the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization was performed and the Variability Account For was used to assess the minimum Number of Synergies (NoS). Mean, standard error and Coefficient of Variability (CoV) of the total Variability Account For (tVAF) for synergies from 1 to the maximum NoS found were considered. No statistical differences were found considering the NoS that ranged from 2 to 7 among all participants. Statistical differences were found in the tVAF between PD patients and healthy subjects. No statistical differences were found between PD patients OFF and ON state of therapy for all NoS. Finally, the minimum NoS of PD strongly correlated with specific clinical evaluation scores, such as cognitive function and bradykinesia. These findings unveiled poor balance control strategies in PD patients, depending on cognitive and motor impairment and not responding to dopaminergic treatment.",<=10,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,EMG abnormalities,BioPotential,,EMG,,,,

These feature vectors were subsequently mapped to the predicted quality scores through several regression methods, including support vector regression, Gaussian process regression, and deep learning. Analyses of subjective speech quality ratings showed that Parkinsonian speech quality was significantly poorer than control subjects' speech quality, and that the amplification devices differentially affected perceived quality of Parkinsonian speech. Objective analyses revealed disparity in performance among feature vectors and mappers, with some feature vector and mapper combinations exhibiting statistically similar correlations with subjective ratings.

Thus, a frequent and objective PD assessment is highly valuable for effective health management of people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). Here, we propose a method for monitoring PwP by stochastically modeling the relationships between wrist movements during unscripted daily activities and corresponding annotations about clinical displays of movement abnormalities. We approach the estimation of PD motor signs by independently modeling and hierarchically stacking Gaussian process models for three classes of commonly observed movement abnormalities in PwP including tremor, (non-tremulous) bradykinesia, and (non-tremulous) dyskinesia. We use clinically adopted severity measures as annotations for training the models, thus allowing our multi-layer Gaussian process prediction models to estimate not only their presence but also their severities. The experimental validation of our approach demonstrates strong agreement of the model predictions with these PD annotations. Our results show that the proposed method produces promising results in objective monitoring of movement abnormalities of PD in the presence of arbitrary and unknown voluntary motions, and makes an important step toward continuous monitoring of PD in the home environment.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Tremor, Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia",Wearable,,,,,,
A Novel Positive Transfer Learning Approach for Telemonitoring of ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease,H. Yoon; J. Li,2019,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Machine learning;negative transfer;telemonitoring;transfer learning (TL),"Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices to remotely monitor patients. Taking the Parkinson's disease (PD) as an example, the use of at-home testing device (AHTD) enables remote, internet-based measurement of PD vocal symptoms. Translating AHTD measurement into a unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) through predictive analytics enables cost-effective, convenient, and close tracking of PD progression. Building a predictive model between AHTD measurement and UPDRS is not straightforward because PD patients are highly heterogeneous, which requires patient-specific models. Learning a patient-specific model faces the challenge of limited data. Transfer learning (TL) tackles this challenge by leveraging other patients' information to make up the data shortage when modeling a target patient. Among different TL methods, the category of parameter transfer methods is more appropriate for the telemonitoring application because it transfers patient-specific model parameters but not patients' data. However, existing parameter transfer methods fall short because not every other patient's information is helpful and blind transfer causes the problem of negative transfer. To tackle this limitation, we propose a positive TL (PTL) method. We provide an in-depth theoretical study on the risk and condition for negative transfer to happen, which further drive the development of novel PTL algorithms that are robust to negative transfer. We apply PTL to predict UPDRS of 42 PD patients using their AHTD vocal measurement. PTL achieves significantly better accuracy compared with single learning and one-model-fits-all approaches.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

As a biomarker to detect FOG, the Freeze index (FI), which is defined as the ratio of the areas under power spectra in `freeze' band and in `locomotion' band, can negatively be affected by poor time and frequency resolution of time-frequency spectrum estimate when short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or Wavelet transform (WT) is used. In this study, a novel high-resolution parametric time-frequency spectral estimation method is proposed to improve the accuracy of FI. A time-varying autoregressive moving average model (TV-ARMA) is first identified where the time-varying parameters are estimated using an asymmetric basis function expansion method. The TV-ARMA model is then transformed into frequency domain to estimate the time-frequency spectrum and calculate the FI. Results evaluated on the Daphnet Freezing of gait Dataset show that the new method improves the time and frequency resolutions of the time-frequency spectrum and the associate FI has better performance in the detection of FOG than its counterparts based on STFT and WT methods do.

Once a FoG event is detected, these systems generate a sequence of rhythmic stimuli to allow the patient restarting the march. While these solutions are effective in detecting FoG events, they are unable to predict FoG to prevent its occurrence. This paper fills in the gap by presenting a machine learning-based approach that classifies accelerometer data from PD patients, recognizing a pre-FOG phase to further anticipate FoG occurrence in advance. Gait was monitored by three tri-axial accelerometer sensors worn on the back, hip and ankle. Gait features were then extracted from the accelerometer's raw data through data windowing and non-linear dimensionality reduction. A k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was used to classify gait in three classes of events: pre-FoG, no-FoG and FoG. The accuracy of the proposed solution was compared to state of-the-art approaches. Our study showed that: (i) we achieved performances overcoming the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of FoG detection, (ii) we were able, for the very first time in the literature, to predict FoG by identifying the pre-FoG events with an average sensitivity and specificity of, respectively, 94.1% and 97.1%, and (iii) our algorithm can be executed on resource-constrained devices.

These methods are based on convolutional neural network and long short-term memory networks architectures to learn spatiotemporal features, automatically end-to-end from raw GRF sensor signals. In a case study on Parkinson's disease (PD) data, spatiotemporal signals of gait for PD patient and healthy subjects are processed and classified, resulting an effective gait pattern classification with a precision performance of 96%. Deep learning considerably achieved better classification results, compared to the shallow learning methods with the handcrafted features. This implies that for the purpose of automatic decision-making, it is beneficial to utilize deep learning methods to analyse GRF. This insight is portable across a range of industrial tasks that involve complex spatiotemporal GRF signals classification. The proposed models are computationally efficient and able to achieve high classification precision from a large set of GRF signals.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,,,,,
Vision-based Freezing of gait Detection with Anatomic Directed Graph Representation,K. Hu; Z. Wang; S. Mei; K. Ehgoetz; T. Yao; S. Lewis; D. Feng,2019,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Parkinson's disease;Freezing of gait detection;deep learning;graph convolution neural network,"Parkinson's disease significantly impacts the life quality of millions of people around the world. While Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most common symptoms of the disease, it is time-consuming and subjective to assess FoG for well-trained experts. Therefore, it is highly desirable to devise computer-aided FoG detection methods for the purpose of objective and time-efficient assessment. In this study, in line with the gold standard of FoG clinical assessment which requires video or direct observation, we propose one of the first vision-based methods for automatic FoG detection. To better characterize FoG patterns, instead of learning an overall representation of a video, we propose a novel architecture of graph convolution neural network and represent each video as a directed graph where FoG related candidate regions are the vertices. A weakly-supervised learning strategy and a weighted adjacency matrix estimation layer are proposed to eliminate the resource expensive data annotation required for fully supervised learning. As a result, the interference of visual information irrelevant to FoG, such as gait motion of supporting staff involved in clinical assessments, has been reduced to improve FoG detection performance by identifying the vertices contributing to FoG events. To further improve the performance, the global context of a clinical video is also considered and several fusion strategies with graph predictions are investigated. Experimental results on more than 100 videos collected from 45 patients during a clinical assessment demonstrated promising performance of our proposed method with an AUC of 0.887.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Video Recording,,,,,,

Three physical therapy tasks with multiple difficulty levels are selected to help patients with PD improve balance and mobility. Patients' movements are captured by a Kinect sensor. Criteria for each task are carefully designed by our PT co-author such that the patient's performance can be evaluated in an automated manner. Given the patient's motion data, we propose a two-phase human action understanding algorithm TPHAU to understand the patient's movements, and an error identification model to identify the patient's movement errors. To enable automated task recommendation, a machine learning-based model is trained from real patient and PT data to provide accurate, personalized, and timely task update recommendation for patients with PD, thereby emulating a real PT's behavior. Real patient data have been collected in the clinic to train the models.

Quantitative Evaluation of Human Finger Tapping Movements Through Magnetic Measurements,K. Shima; T. Tsuji; A. Kandori; M. Yokoe; S. Sakoda,2019,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,Diagnosis support;finger tapping (FT) movement;magnetic sensor;motor function evaluation;Parkinson's disease (PD),"In this study, a magnetic sensor consisting of two coils was used to measure and evaluate finger tapping (FT) movements for diagnosis support and assessment of motor function. The sensor enables estimation of the distance between the two coil-bearing fingertips according to the nonlinear relationships between voltage and distance. The finger movements measured are evaluated by computing 12 indices, such as the FT interval and maximum amplitude, and radar charts of the evaluation indices are then displayed in real time on a monitor. The user can thus intuitively understand the features of FT movements. Verification experiments on magnetic measurement of finger movements were performed, and the results showed that finger movement could be measured with a high degree of accuracy. The results of finger movement evaluation for 30 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 32 normal elderly subjects showed that all evaluation indices differed significantly for each group, and the proposed system could be used to assess the Unified PD Rating Scale part III FT score by evaluating the number of indices with values greater or smaller than plus/minus double the standard deviation from the measured data of 32 normal elderly subjects. We therefore concluded that the proposed system can be used to quantitatively evaluate the motor function of finger taps.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,,,Magnetic sensor,,,,

Discrimination between PD and APS and within APS groups in early disease stages is a very challenging task. Interestingly, speech disorder is frequently an early and prominent clinical feature of both PD and APS. This renders speech/voice analysis a promising tool for the development of an objective marker to assist neurologists in their diagnosis. This paper is a continuation of a recent work on speech-based differential diagnosis within APS. We address the difficult problem of defining disease-specific speech features which is crucial in the perspective of early differential diagnosis. We investigate this problem by considering the constraint that only a small amount of training data can be available in this setting. To do so, we perform univariate statistical analysis followed by a supervised learning that forces the designed new features to be 1-dimensional. We carry out experiments using speech recordings of MSA and PSP patients. We show that linear classification models allow the definition of new scalar variables which can be considered as speech features which are specific to each disease, MSA and PSP.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

These devices are widely used to treat diseases such as Parkinson, movement disorder, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Security in such devices plays a vital role since it can directly affect the mental, emotional, and physical state of human bodies. In worst-case situations, it can even lead to the patient's death. An adversary in such devices, for instance, can inhibit the normal functionality of the brain by introducing fake stimulation inside the human brain. Nonetheless, the adversary can impair the motor functions, alter impulse control, induce pain, or even modify the emotional pattern of the patient by giving fake stimulations through DBSs. This paper presents a deep learning methodology to predict different attack stimulations in DBSs. The proposed work uses long short-term memory, a type of recurrent network for forecasting and predicting rest tremor velocity.

Evaluating bradykinesia severity is an important part of clinical examinations on PD patients in both diagnosis and monitoring phases. However, subjective evaluations from different clinicians often show low consistency. The research works that explore objective quantification of bradykinesia are mostly based on highly-integrated sensors. Although these sensor-based methods demonstrate applaudable performance, it is unrealistic to promote them for wide use because the special devices they require are far from popularized in daily lives. In this paper, we take advantage of computer vision and machine learning technologies, proposing a vision-based method to automatically and objectively quantify bradykinesia severity. Three bradykinesia-related items are investigated in our study: finger tapping, hand clasping and hand pro/supination. In our method, human pose estimation technology is utilized to extract kinematic characteristics and supervised-learning-based classifiers are employed to generate score ratings. Clinical experiment on 60 patients shows that the scoring accuracy of our method over 360 examination videos is 89.7%, which is competitive with other related works.

This requires a wearable and unobtrusive system capable of estimating ambulatory gait and balance measures, such as the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) and dynamic margin of stability. These estimations require the knowledge of 3-D forces and moments (F&M) and accurate foot positions. Though an existing ambulatory gait and balance system (AGBS) consisting of 3-D F&M sensors and inertial measurement units can be used for the purpose, it is bulky and conspicuous. Resistive pressure sensors were investigated as an alternative to the onboard 3-D F&M sensors. Subject-specific regression models were built to estimate 3-D F&M from 1-D plantar pressures. The model was applicable for different walking speeds. Different pressure sensor configurations were studied to optimize the system complexity and accuracy. Using resistive sensors only under the toe and heel, we were able to estimate the XCoM with a mean absolute rms error of 2.2Ã‚Â±0.3 cm in the walking direction while walking at a preferred speed, when compared to the AGBS. For the same case, the XCoM was classified as ahead or behind the base of support correctly at 97.7Ã‚Â±1.7%.

Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of various user studies involving 23 PD patients, 22 stroke patients and 39 healthy persons are discussed to make design recommendations for designing engaging AR games for objective assessment of upper extremity motor dysfunction.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,Motion Tracker,,Augmented reality,,,,
Monitoring Insole (MONI): A Low Power Solution Toward Daily Gait Monitoring and Analysis,R. Hua; Y. Wang,2019,IEEE Sensors Journal,Early stage disease detection;daily gait monitoring;gait trace;low power,"Gait monitoring and analysis has attracted accumulative attention from the health technology community, with a particular high demand on wearable devices enabling long-term real-time daily gait monitoring. However, the vast majority of existing commercial and emerging technologies use significant electric power, need multiple sensor nodes, and are expensive and complicated to wear. This paper proposes a customized low power, low-cost monitoring insole (MONI) with minimized sensor nodes for real time daily gait monitoring and analysis in an accurate and reliable manner. With one accelerometer positioned at the heel and one at the first metatarsal, key gait features can be extracted and recorded in real-time. Selected gait information will be constructed as personalized daily gait traces to provide a low-power wearable solution for observing user's gait evolution, which is critical for disease detection at early stages, such as Parkinson's disease. To minimize the power consumption while efficiently collecting scattered gait information throughout the day, a working-mode management (WMM) algorithm, and an auto activity recognition (AAR) algorithm are developed to intelligently sample the right amount of true walking gait data in real-time. MONI is tested and validated both in the lab (with an accuracy of over 88.74% and a strong correlation intra class correlations (ICC) over 0.83). A pilot study is conducted in the field, suggesting less than 2-mW daily power consumption for 5500 steps of walking for an office worker.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

Wearable sensors do not only provide the opportunity to assess the behavior of patients as it happens in their daily life activities, but also provide quantitative, meaningful feedback data of patients to their therapists. This can pinpoint the cause of problems and help in maximizing their recovery rates. The popularity of using wearable sensors has received attention from a number of researchers from both the academic and industrial fields in the past few years. The different types of wearable sensors have given birth to the realization of a standard measurement model that can support different types of applications. Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are starting to replace traditional healthcare systems by enabling long-term monitoring of patients and tele-rehabilitation, especially those who suffer from chronic diseases. This paper investigates using wearable accelerometers and surface electromyography (EMG) in human locomotion monitoring for tele-rehabilitation. It proposes and investigates new positions for the proposed sensors, and compares the measured signals to similar techniques proposed in the literature. Realistic measurements show that the proposed positions of surface EMG sensors (on the forearm muscles) provide more reliable results in the classification of motion abnormality as compared to the sensor positions proposed in the literature (biceps muscles). Seven statistical features were extracted from accelerometer signals, and four time domain (TD) features are extracted from EMG signals. These features are used to construct six machine learning classifiers for automatic classification of Parkinson&rsquo;s tremor. These models include; decision tree (DT), linear discriminant analysis analysis (LDA), k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), boosted tree and bagged tree classifiers. The performance of the applied classifiers is analyzed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and area under ROC (AUC) curve. The results are also compared to corresponding findings in the literature. The experimental results show that the highest classification accuracy is achieved when using the proposed measurement set and bagged tree classifier with a value of 99.6%.",,,Rehabilitation,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,Accelerometer and electromyograph,,,,
Turning Analysis during Standardized Test Using On-Shoe Wearable Sensors in ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease,"Haji Ghassemi, Nooshin; Hannink, Julius; Roth, Nils; GaÃƒÅ¸ner, Heiko; Marxreiter, Franz; Klucken, Jochen; Eskofier, BjÃƒÂ¶rn",2019,Sensors,ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; pathological gait; turning analysis; wearable sensors; mobile gait analysis,Mobile gait analysis systems using wearable sensors have the potential to analyze and monitor pathological gait in a finer scale than ever before. A closer look at gait in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) reveals that turning has its own characteristics and requires its own analysis. The goal of this paper is to present a system with on-shoe wearable sensors in order to analyze the abnormalities of turning in a standardized gait test for PD. We investigated turning abnormalities in a large cohort of 108 PD patients and 42 age-matched controls. We quantified turning through several spatio-temporal parameters. Analysis of turn-derived parameters revealed differences of turn-related gait impairment in relation to different disease stages and motor impairment. Our findings confirm and extend the results from previous studies and show the applicability of our system in turning analysis. Our system can provide insight into the turning in PD and be used as a complement for physicians&rsquo; gait assessment and to monitor patients in their daily environment.,,,Diagnosis,Activities of Daily Living (turning),Wearable,,IMU,,,,

One-hundred and forty-four people with PD and 79 age-matched healthy controls wore eight inertial sensors while performing tasks to measure five domains of balance: standing posture (Sway), anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), automatic postural responses (APRs), dynamic posture (Gait) and limits of stability (LOS). To reduce the initial 93 measures, we selected uncorrelated measures that were most sensitive to PD. After applying a threshold on the Standardized Mean Difference between PD and healthy controls, 44 measures remained; and after reducing highly correlated measures, 24 measures remained. The four most sensitive measures were from APAs and Gait domains. The random forest with 10-fold cross-validation on the remaining measures (n = 24) showed an accuracy to separate PD from healthy controls of 82.4%&mdash;identical to result for all measures. Measures from the most sensitive domains, APAs and Gait, were significantly correlated with the severity of disease and with patient-related outcomes.

Towards Real-Time Prediction of Freezing of gait in Patients With ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease: Addressing the Class Imbalance Problem,"Naghavi, Nader; Miller, Aaron; Wade, Eric",2019,Sensors,ensemble classifier; data synthesis; ADASYN; cost of classification; Freezing of gait; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; wearable sensors,"Freezing of gait (FoG) is a common motor symptom in patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). FoG impairs gait initiation and walking and increases fall risk. Intelligent external cueing systems implementing FoG detection algorithms have been developed to help patients recover gait after freezing. However, predicting FoG before its occurrence enables preemptive cueing and may prevent FoG. Such prediction remains challenging given the relative infrequency of freezing compared to non-freezing events. In this study, we investigated the ability of individual and ensemble classifiers to predict FoG. We also studied the effect of the ADAptive SYNthetic (ADASYN) sampling algorithm and classification cost on classifier performance. Eighteen PD patients performed a series of daily walking tasks wearing accelerometers on their ankles, with nine experiencing FoG. The ensemble classifier formed by Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multi-Layer Perceptron using bagging techniques demonstrated highest performance (F1 = 90.7) when synthetic FoG samples were added to the training set and class cost was set as twice that of normal gait. The model identified 97.4% of the events, with 66.7% being predicted. This study demonstrates our algorithm&rsquo;s potential for accurate prediction of gait events and the provision of preventive cueing in spite of limited event frequency.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,Also Therapy
Wearable Sensors for Estimation of Parkinsonian Tremor Severity during Free Body Movements,"Hssayeni, Murtadha; Jimenez-Shahed, Joohi; Burack, Michelle; Ghoraani, Behnaz",2019,Sensors,Parkinsonian tremor; continuous monitoring; wearable sensors; gradient tree boosting; deep learning; LSTM,"Tremor is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD) that reduces the quality of life. Tremor is measured as part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III. However, the assessment is based on onsite physical examinations and does not fully represent the patients&rsquo; tremor experience in their day-to-day life. Our objective in this paper was to develop algorithms that, combined with wearable sensors, can estimate total Parkinsonian tremor as the patients performed a variety of free body movements. We developed two methods: an ensemble model based on gradient tree boosting and a deep learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The developed methods were assessed on gyroscope sensor data from 24 PD subjects. Our analysis demonstrated that the method based on gradient tree boosting provided a high correlation (r = 0.96 using held-out testing and r = 0.93 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation) between the estimated and clinically assessed tremor subscores in comparison to the LSTM-based method with a moderate correlation (r = 0.84 using held-out testing and r = 0.77 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation).

This concerns not only the choice of the algorithm and sensors, but methods are often designed to detect tremors in one specific group of patients during the performance of a specific task. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold. First, an objective quantitative method to detect tremor windows (TWs) in accelerometer and electromyography recordings is introduced. Second, the tremor stability index (TSI) is determined to indicate the advantage of detecting TWs prior to analysis. Ten ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease (PD) patients, ten essential tremor (ET) patients, and ten healthy controls (HC) performed a resting, postural and movement task. Data was split into 3-s windows, and the power spectral density was calculated for each window. The relative power around the peak frequency with respect to the power in the tremor band was used to classify the windows as either tremor or non-tremor. The method yielded a specificity of 96.45%, sensitivity of 84.84%, and accuracy of 90.80% of tremor detection. During tremors, significant differences were found between groups in all three parameters.

The system performs the automated assessments of six motor tasks of the unified Parkinson&rsquo;s disease rating scale, and it is equipped with a gesture-based human machine interface designed to facilitate the user interaction and the system management. The usability of the system has been evaluated by means of standard questionnaires, and the accuracy of the automated assessment has been verified experimentally.

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether an ambulatory wearable device could predict the LR from the response to the first morning dose. The ON and OFF scores were sorted into six categories of severity so that separating ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kinetigraph (PKG) features corresponding to the ON and OFF scores became a multi-class classification problem according to whether they fell below or above the threshold for each class. Candidate features were extracted from the PKG data and matched to the class labels. Several linear and non-linear candidate statistical models were examined and compared to classify the six categories of severity. The resulting model predicted a clinically significant LR with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.92. This study shows that ambulatory data could be used to identify a clinically significant response to levodopa. This study has also identified practical steps that would enhance the reliability of this test in future studies.,,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

This work deals with the analysis of the arm swing by using wearable inertial sensors. A total of 250 records of 39 different subjects were used for this task. Fifteen subjects of this group had motor dysfunctions (MD). The subjects had to perform the standardized Timed Up and Go (TUG) test to ensure that the recordings were comparable.

The objective of this study was to compare the impact of walking protocols and gait assessment systems on the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) for classification of PD. 93 PD and 103 controls performed two walking protocols at their normal pace: (i) four times along a 10 m walkway (intermittent walk-IW), (ii) walking for 2 minutes on a 25 m oval circuit (continuous walk-CW). 14 gait characteristics were extracted from two different systems (an instrumented walkway&mdash;GAITRite; and an accelerometer attached at the lower back&mdash;Axivity). SVM and RF were trained on normalized data (accounting for step velocity, gender, age and BMI) and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation with area under the curve (AUC). Overall performance was higher for both systems during CW compared to IW. SVM performed better than RF. With SVM, during CW Axivity significantly outperformed GAITRite (AUC: 87.83 &plusmn; 7.81% vs. 80.49 &plusmn; 9.85%); during IW systems performed similarly.

Gait and balance impairments, frequent complications in later disease stages, are poorly responsive to classic dopamine-replacement therapy. Although recent findings suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can have a role in improving motor skills, there is scarce evidence for this, especially considering the difficulty to objectively assess motor function. Therefore, we used wearable electronics to measure motor abilities, and further evaluated the gait and balance features of 10 PD patients, before and (three days and one month) after the tDCS. To assess patients&rsquo; abilities, we adopted six motor tasks, obtaining 72 meaningful motor features.

Cueing Paradigms to Improve Gait and Posture in ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease: A Narrative Review,"Muthukrishnan, Niveditha; Abbas, James; Shill, Holly; Krishnamurthi, Narayanan",2019,Sensors,ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; cueing; gait; posture; rehabilitation; wearable sensors,"Progressive gait dysfunction is one of the primary motor symptoms in people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). It is generally expressed as reduced step length and gait speed and as increased variability in step time and step length. People with PD also exhibit stooped posture which disrupts gait and impedes social interaction. The gait and posture impairments are usually resistant to the pharmacological treatment, worsen as the disease progresses, increase the likelihood of falls, and result in higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. These impairments may be caused by perceptual deficiencies (poor spatial awareness and loss of temporal rhythmicity) due to the disruptions in processing intrinsic information related to movement initiation and execution which can result in misperceptions of the actual effort required to perform a desired movement and maintain a stable posture. Consequently, people with PD often depend on external cues during execution of motor tasks. Numerous studies involving open-loop cues have shown improvements in gait and Freezing of gait (FoG) in people with PD. However, the benefits of cueing may be limited, since cues are provided in a consistent/rhythmic manner irrespective of how well a person follows them. This limitation can be addressed by providing feedback in real-time to the user about performance (closed-loop cueing) which may help to improve movement patterns. Some studies that used closed-loop cueing observed improvements in gait and posture in PD, but the treadmill-based setup in a laboratory would not be accessible outside of a research setting, and the skills learned may not readily and completely transfer to overground locomotion in the community. Technologies suitable for cueing outside of laboratory environments could facilitate movement practice during daily activities at home or in the community and could strongly reinforce movement patterns and improve clinical outcomes. This narrative review presents an overview of cueing paradigms that have been utilized to improve gait and posture in people with PD and recommends development of closed-loop wearable systems that can be used at home or in the community to improve gait and posture in PD.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait,Cueing,,,,,,

Three sustained phonetic voice recordings, /a/, /u/ and /m/, from 22 CO (mean age = 66.91) and 24 PD (mean age = 71.83) participants were analysed. FD was first computed for PD and CO voice recordings, followed by the computation of NMI between the test groups: PD&ndash;CO, PD&ndash;PD and CO&ndash;CO. Four features reported in the literature&mdash;normalised pitch period entropy (Norm. PPE), glottal-to-noise excitation ratio (GNE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and glottal closing quotient (ClQ)&mdash;were also computed for comparison with the proposed complexity measures. The statistical significance of the features was tested using a one-way ANOVA test. Support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was used to classify the test groups, using a leave-one-out validation method. The results showed that PD voice recordings had lower FD compared to CO (p &lt; 0.008). It was also observed that the average NMI between CO voice recordings was significantly lower compared with the CO&ndash;PD and PD&ndash;PD groups (p &lt; 0.036) for the three phonetic sounds. The average NMI and FD demonstrated higher accuracy (&gt;80%) in differentiating the test groups compared with other speech feature-based classifications. This study has demonstrated that the voices of PD patients has reduced FD, and NMI between voice recordings of PD&ndash;CO and PD&ndash;PD is higher compared with CO&ndash;CO. This suggests that the use of NMI obtained from the sample voice, when paired with known groups of CO and PD, can be used to identify PD voices.

Automatic Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Evolutionary Approach for Facing the Interpretability Problem,"Senatore, Rosa; Della Cioppa, Antonio; Marcelli, Angelo",2019,Information,E-health; explainable artificial intelligence; Parkinson disease; machine learning; evolutionary computation,"Background: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for automatic diagnoses is increasingly in the clinical field, being a useful support for the identification of several diseases. Nonetheless, the acceptance of AI-based diagnoses by the physicians is hampered by the black-box approach implemented by most performing systems, which do not clearly state the classification rules adopted. Methods: In this framework we propose a classification method based on a Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) approach, which allows for the automatic identification of the presence of the disease, and concurrently, provides the explicit classification model used by the system. Results: The proposed approach has been evaluated on the publicly available HandPD dataset, which contains handwriting samples drawn by Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients and healthy controls. We show that our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods, and more importantly, allows the physician to identify an explicit model relevant for the diagnosis based on the most informative subset of features. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that the proposed approach is particularly appealing in that, starting from the explicit model, it allows the physicians to derive a set of guidelines for defining novel testing protocols and intervention strategies.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Images,,HandPD dataset,,,,

Specifically, we developed a new hybrid feature extraction method to represent the longitudinal changes of motor function from the sensor data. Next, we developed a classification model based on random forest to learn the changes in the patterns of the sensor data as the severity of the motor function changes. We evaluated our algorithm using data from 24 subjects with idiopathic PD as they performed a variety of daily routine activities. A leave-one-subject-out assessment of the algorithm resulted in 83.33% accuracy, indicating that our approach holds a great promise to passively detect degree of motor fluctuation severity from continuous monitoring of an individual&rsquo;s free body movements. Such a sensor-based assessment system and algorithm combination could provide the objective and comprehensive information about the fluctuation severity that can be used by the treating physician to effectively adjust therapy for PD patients with troublesome motor fluctuation.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,"Limb movements, Activities of Daily Living",Wearable,,IMU,,,,
A Non-Invasive Medical Device for ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Patients with Episodes of Freezing of gait,"Punin, Catalina; Barzallo, Boris; Clotet, Roger; Bermeo, Alexander; Bravo, Marco; Bermeo, Juan; Llumiguano, Carlos",2019,Sensors,sensors; neurodegenerative disorders; clinical assessment; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Freezing of gait; discrete wavelet transform; vibratory stimulus,"A critical symptom of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is the occurrence of Freezing of gait (FOG), an episodic disorder that causes frequent falls and consequential injuries in PD patients. There are various auditory, visual, tactile, and other types of stimulation interventions that can be used to induce PD patients to escape FOG episodes. In this article, we describe a low cost wearable system for non-invasive gait monitoring and external delivery of superficial vibratory stimulation to the lower extremities triggered by FOG episodes. The intended purpose is to reduce the duration of the FOG episode, thus allowing prompt resumption of gait to prevent major injuries. The system, based on an Android mobile application, uses a tri-axial accelerometer device for gait data acquisition. Gathered data is processed via a discrete wavelet transform-based algorithm that precisely detects FOG episodes in real time. Detection activates external vibratory stimulation of the legs to reduce FOG time. The integration of detection and stimulation in one low cost device is the chief novel contribution of this work.

Wearable Sensors System for an Improved Analysis of Freezing of gait in ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease Using Electromyography and Inertial Signals,"Mazzetta, Ivan; Zampogna, Alessandro; Suppa, Antonio; Gumiero, Alessandro; Pessione, Marco; Irrera, Fernanda",2019,Sensors,wearable sensors; sensor fusion; inertial signal; surface electromyography; gait analysis; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; telemedicine,"We propose a wearable sensor system for automatic, continuous and ubiquitous analysis of Freezing of gait (FOG), in patients affected by Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. FOG is an unpredictable gait disorder with different clinical manifestations, as the trembling and the shuffling-like phenotypes, whose underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood yet. Typical trembling-like subtype features are lack of postural adaptation and abrupt trunk inclination, which in general can increase the fall probability. The targets of this work are detecting the FOG episodes, distinguishing the phenotype and analyzing the muscle activity during and outside FOG, toward a deeper insight in the disorder pathophysiology and the assessment of the fall risk associated to the FOG subtype. To this aim, gyroscopes and surface electromyography integrated in wearable devices sense simultaneously movements and action potentials of antagonist leg muscles. Dedicated algorithms allow the timely detection of the FOG episode and, for the first time, the automatic distinction of the FOG phenotypes, which can enable associating a fall risk to the subtype. Thanks to the possibility of detecting muscles contractions and stretching exactly during FOG, a deeper insight into the pathophysiological underpinnings of the different phenotypes can be achieved, which is an innovative approach with respect to the state of art.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,IMU and EMG,,,,

Kin-FOG: Automatic Simulated Freezing of gait (FOG) Assessment System for ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease,"Soltaninejad, Sara; Cheng, Irene; Basu, Anup",2019,Sensors,parkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease (PD); Freezing of gait (FOG); kinect; simple walking (SW); walking with turning (WWT); standing mode (ST); trajectory; angular displacement,"Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is one of the leading neurological disorders in the world with an increasing incidence rate for the elderly. Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most incapacitating symptoms for PD especially in the later stages of the disease. FOG is a short absence or reduction of ability to walk for PD patients which can cause fall, reduction in patients&rsquo; quality of life, and even death. Existing FOG assessments by doctors are based on a patient&rsquo;s diaries and experts&rsquo; manual video analysis which give subjective, inaccurate, and unreliable results. In the present research, an automatic FOG assessment system is designed for PD patients to provide objective information to neurologists about the FOG condition and the symptom&rsquo;s characteristics. The proposed FOG assessment system uses an RGB-D sensor based on Microsoft Kinect V2 for capturing data for 5 healthy subjects who are trained to imitate the FOG phenomenon. The proposed FOG assessment system is called &ldquo;Kin-FOG&rdquo;. The analysis of foot joint trajectory of the motion captured by Kinect is used to find the FOG episodes. The evaluation of Kin-FOG is performed by two types of experiments, including: (1) simple walking (SW); and (2) walking with turning (WWT). Since the standing mode has features similar to a FOG episode, our Kin-FOG system proposes a method to distinguish between the FOG and standing episodes. Therefore, two general groups of experiments are conducted with standing state (WST) and without standing state (WOST). The gradient displacement of the angle between the foot and the ground is used as the feature for discriminating between FOG and standing modes. These experiments are conducted with different numbers of FOGs for getting reliable and general results. The Kin-FOG system reports the number of FOGs, their lengths, and the time slots when they occur. Experimental results demonstrate Kin-FOG has around 90% accuracy rate for FOG prediction in both experiments for different tasks (SW, WWT). The proposed Kin-FOG system can be used as a remote application at a patient&rsquo;s home or a rehabilitation clinic for sending a neurologist the required FOG information. The reliability and generality of the proposed system will be evaluated for bigger data sets of actual PD subjects.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Motion Tracker,,Microsoft Kinect V2,,,,

Medication status and dual-tasking on turning strategies in Parkinson disease,"Adamson, M. B.; Gilmore, G.; Stratton, T. W.; Baktash, N.; Jog, M. S.",2019,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,"Parkinson disease, Gait, Turning strategies, Medication state, Dual-tasking, Movement disorders, Motor control","Background
  Parkinson disease (PD) patients have turning impairments that may increase fall risk. Clinics lack specialized kinematic equipment used in gait and turn analysis and require a simple method to evaluate fall risk and advise patients in turning strategy selection.
  Objectives
  To enhance understanding of PD turning strategies and determine if turning can be assessed using a video-recording and categorization method, we compared 180-degree and 90-degree turns as a function of medication status and dual-tasking (DT).
  Methods
  21 PD participants (H&Y stage 1--3) in PD-ON and PD-OFF medication states and 16 controls completed 180-degree and 90-degree turn-tasks with and without DT. Video-recordings of tasks permitted classification of 180-degree turns into Few-Step turns (FST) vs. Multi-Step turns (MST) and 90-degree turns into Step vs. Spin-turns. FST were further sub-classified into Twisting vs. Sideways turns and MST into Backward, Festination, Forward or Wheeling turns. Percentages of subtypes were analyzed across groups by task.
  Results
  IN 180-degree tasks, there was an effect of group: FST vs. MST F(2,55)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯9.578, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯<Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001. PD participants in the off-medication state (PD-OFF) produced significantly more MST with a larger number of different turning subtypes vs. controls or PD on medication (PD-ON). In 90-degree tasks, controls significantly increased their proportion of Step-turns while DT (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯<Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), an adaptation not observed in PD-ON or PD-OFF.
  Conclusions
  PD turning impairments may stem from an inability to select a unified turning strategy and to adapt to the turning environment, which may be exacerbated in PD-OFF. Video-analysis may prove beneficial in predicting a clinical course for PD patients by revealing features of turning dysfunction.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait,Video Recording,,Video camera,,j.jns.2018.11.028,Research Article,

However, no work has analyzed in detail the importance of the different phonemes in the automatic detection of PD from the speech. This work proposes new approaches for this detection by using new classification schemes that allow to compare independently the different phonetic units of patients and controls employed during several speech tasks. Three different parkinsonian corpora were used allowing cross-validation and cross-corpora trials. The results of cross-validation trials (k-folds) provided accuracies between 81% and 94%, with AUC between 0.87 and 0.97 depending on the corpus, while cross-corpora trials yielded accuracies between 66% and 76% with AUC between 0.76 and 0.87. These results suggest that PD affects to the articulatory sequence as a whole, influencing more clearly phonetic units requiring a higher narrowing of the vocal tract. Additionally, text-dependent utterances are considered as the recommended speech task for the detection of PD in this type of schemes as these allow to compare more precisely the phonetic units of patients and controls. Lastly, this work discusses the existence of a glass ceiling in the accuracy of the systems for the automatic detection of PD using speech, concluding that this is below 95% for most of the cases.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.bspc.2018.10.020,Research Article,

As approximately 90% percent of PD patients exhibit some form of vocal disorders in the earlier stages of the disease, the recent PD telediagnosis studies focus on the detection of the vocal impairments from sustained vowel phonations or running speech of the subjects. In these studies, various speech signal processing algorithms have been used to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment, and the calculated features were fed to learning algorithms to construct reliable decision support systems. In this study, we apply, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to the voice signals of PD patients for feature extraction, which has higher frequency resolution than the classical discrete wavelet transform. We compare the effectiveness of TQWT with the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods used in diagnosis of PD from vocal disorders. For this purpose, we have collected the voice recordings of 252 subjects in the context of this study and extracted multiple feature subsets from the voice recordings. The feature subsets are fed to multiple classifiers and the predictions of the classifiers are combined with ensemble learning approaches. The results show that TQWT performs better or comparable to the state-of-the-art speech signal processing techniques used in PD classification.

  Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders that affect neurons in the brain resulting in a debilitating condition and progressive degeneration of nerve cells. These diseases involve different aspects among which speech impairment. Vocal signal analysis is used to evaluate this impairment and to discriminate normal from pathological voices.
  Materials and methods
  In this paper, two methods of vocal signal analysis have been proposed to evaluate an anomalous condition in human speech, known as dysarthria, useful to compare pathological and healthy voices. Parkinson and Multiple Sclerosis disease have been considered and patients affected by both pathologies have been enrolled. The methods have been tested on 153 voice signals belonging to: 39 healthy subjects (HS), 60 patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and 54 patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Acoustic (F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR) and vowel metric (tVSA, qVSA, FCR) features have been extracted.
  Results
  The results report significant differences in almost all of these features in pathological and healthy voices by performing statistical tests. F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR, tVSA and FCR are statistically significant features thus they can be used as indicators in the diagnosis of dysarthria-related diseases such as in PD and MS. The results suggest that the applied methodologies are efficient and useful in characterizing the different behavior of vocal signal in healthy and pathological subjects. Consequently, they could be a valid support for physicians in disease evaluation and progression monitoring.
  Conclusions
  The contribution aims to evaluate, support and diagnose the comorbidity in pathological patients verifying the co-occurrence of speech and neurological disorders in the same individual. The proposed solution is studied and implemented to be efficient and low cost following the model of precision medicine to customize clinical practice in disease diagnosis and treatment.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.ijmedinf.2018.11.008,Research Article,

  When older adults turn to sit, about 80% of the subjects complete the turn before starting to sit i.e., a distinct-strategy, while in about 20%, part of the turning and sitting take place concurrently, i.e., an overlapping-strategy. A prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlap interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) are related to worse motor symptoms and poorer cognition. In the present study, we evaluated what strategy is employed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) when they transition from turning to sitting.
  Methods
  96 participants with PD performed turn to sit as part of the Timed Up and Go test, both with and without medications, while wearing a body-fixed sensor. We quantified the turn-to-sit transition and determined which strategy (distinct or overlapping) was employed. We then stratified the cases and used regression models adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight to examine the associations of the D-interval or O-interval with parkinsonian features and cognition.
  Results
  Most patients (66%) employed the overlapping-strategy, both off and on anti-parkinsonian medications. Longer O-intervals were associated with longer duration of PD, more severe PD motor symptoms, a higher postural-instability-gait-disturbance (PIGD) score, and worse Freezing of gait. Longer D-intervals were not associated with disease duration or PD motor symptoms. Neither the D- nor O-intervals were related to cognitive function. Individuals who employed the overlapping-strategy had more severe postural instability (i.e., higher PIGD scores), as compared to those who used the distinct-strategy.
  Significance
  In contrast to older adults without PD, most patients with PD utilize the overlapping strategy. Poorer postural and gait control are associated with the strategy choice and with the duration of concurrent performance of turning and sitting. Additional work is needed to further explicate the mechanisms underlying these strategies and their clinical implications.",,,Diagnosis,"Gait,Balance",Wearable,,"Accelerometer,Gyroscope",100,j.gaitpost.2018.10.018,Research Article,

Gait signal is one of the best features to characterize and detect movement disorders caused by a malfunction in parts of the brain and nervous system of the patients with PD. Various classification approaches using spatiotemporal gait variables have been presented earlier to classify Parkinson's gait. In this study we propose a novel method for gait pattern classification between patients with PD and healthy controls, based upon phase space reconstruction (PSR), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and neural networks. First, vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs) at specific positions of human feet are captured and then phase space is reconstructed. The properties associated with the gait system dynamics are preserved in the reconstructed phase space. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been used. These measured parameters demonstrate significant difference in gait dynamics between the two groups and have been utilized to form a reference variable set. Second, reference variables are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and the third IMFs are extracted and served as gait features. Third, neural networks are then used as the classifier to distinguish between patients with PD and healthy controls based on the difference of gait dynamics preserved in the gait features between the two groups. Finally, experiments are carried out on 93 PD patients and 73 healthy subjects to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using 2-fold, 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation styles, the correct classification rates are reported to be 91.46%, 96.99% and 98.80%, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic and non-invasive classification between patients with PD and healthy subjects.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,Force sensor,uk,j.neunet.2018.12.012,Research Article,

  Depression is a predominant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often under recognised and undertreated. To improve identification of depression in PD it is imperative to examine objective brain-related markers. The present study addresses this gap by using electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the processing of emotionally valanced words in PD.
  Methods
  Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed an affective priming task while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Prime and target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a short 250Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Depression was measured using an established rating scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether event-related potentials (ERP) varied as a function of depression scores.
  Results
  Key ERP findings reveal reduced responses in parietal midline P300, N400 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) difference waves between congruent and incongruent neutral targets in patients with higher depression scores.
  Limitations
  Comparisons of ERPs were limited by insufficient classification of participants with and without clinical depression. A majority of PD patients who had high depression scores were excluded from the analysis as they were receiving antidepressant and/or anxiolytic medications which could interfere with ERP sensitivity.
  Conclusions
  The present study suggests that the Pz-P300, N400 and LPP are ERP markers relates to emotional dysfunction in PD. These findings thus advance current knowledge regarding the neurophysiological markers of a common neuropsychiatric deficit in PD.",,,Diagnosis,Depression,BioPotential,,EEG,,j.jad.2018.11.094,Research Article,

  Cortical dysfunctioning significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).
  Objective
  We aimed at testing whether an acute levodopa administration has measurable and specific cortical effects possibly related to striatal dopaminergic deficit.
  Methods
  In thirteen PD patients, we measured the electroencephalographic responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS/EEG) of the supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobule (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8) before and after an acute intake of levodopa. We also performed a single-photon emission computed tomography and [123I]N-Ãâ€°-fluoropropyl-2ÃŽÂ²-carbomethoxy-3ÃŽÂ²-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane to identify the more affected and the less affected brain side in each patient, according to the dopaminergic innervation loss of the putamen. Cortical excitability changes before and after an acute intake of levodopa were computed and compared between the more and the less affected brain side at the single-patient as well as at the group level.
  Results
  We found that levodopa intake induces a significant increase (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯<Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01) of cortical excitability nearby the supplementary motor area in the more affected brain side, greater (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯<Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.025) than in the less affected brain side. Notably, cortical excitability changes nearby the superior parietal lobule were not statistically significant.
  Conclusions
  These results strengthen the idea that dysfunction of specific cortico-subcortical circuits may contribute to pathophysiology of PD symptoms. Most important, they support the use of navigated TMS/EEG as a non-invasive tool to better understand the pathophysiology of PD.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,EEG abnormalities,BioPotential,,EEG,,j.brs.2018.10.011,Research Article,

Clinical and rsEEG rhythms in PD with dementia (NÃ‚ = 35), PD with mild cognitive impairment (NÃ‚ = 50), PD with normal cognition (NÃ‚ = 35), and normal (NÃ‚ = 50) older adults were available from an international archive. Cortical rsEEG sources were estimated by exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Compared with the normal older group, the PD groups showed reduced occipital alpha sources and increased widespread delta (<4Ã‚ Hz) sources. Widespread frontal and temporal alpha sources exhibited an increase in PD with dementia compared with PD with mild cognitive impairment and PD with normal cognition groups, as function of dopamine depletion severity, typically greater in the former than the latter groups. A daily dose of levodopa induced a widespread reduction in cortical delta and alpha sources in a subgroup of 13 PD patients under standard chronic dopaminergic regimen. In PD patients in quiet wakefulness, alpha cortical source activations may reflect an excitatory effect of dopamine neuromodulation.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,"Cognitive activity,EEG abnormalities",BioPotential,,EEG,,j.neurobiolaging.2018.08.010,Research Article,
