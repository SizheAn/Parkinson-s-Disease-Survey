  Depression is a predominant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often under recognised and undertreated. To improve identification of depression in PD it is imperative to examine objective brain-related markers. The present study addresses this gap by using electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the processing of emotionally valanced words in PD.
  Methods
  Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed an affective priming task while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Prime and target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a short 250â€¯ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Depression was measured using an established rating scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether event-related potentials (ERP) varied as a function of depression scores.
  Results
  Key ERP findings reveal reduced responses in parietal midline P300, N400 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) difference waves between congruent and incongruent neutral targets in patients with higher depression scores.
  Limitations
  Comparisons of ERPs were limited by insufficient classification of participants with and without clinical depression. A majority of PD patients who had high depression scores were excluded from the analysis as they were receiving antidepressant and/or anxiolytic medications which could interfere with ERP sensitivity.
  Conclusions
  The present study suggests that the Pz-P300, N400 and LPP are ERP markers relates to emotional dysfunction in PD. These findings thus advance current knowledge regarding the neurophysiological markers of a common neuropsychiatric deficit in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Depression,BioPotential,,EEG,,j.jad.2018.11.094,Research Article,
Medication status and dual-tasking on turning strategies in Parkinson disease,"Adamson, M. B.; Gilmore, G.; Stratton, T. W.; Baktash, N.; Jog, M. S.",2019,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,"Parkinson disease, Gait, Turning strategies, Medication state, Dual-tasking, Movement disorders, Motor control","Background
  Parkinson disease (PD) patients have turning impairments that may increase fall risk. Clinics lack specialized kinematic equipment used in gait and turn analysis and require a simple method to evaluate fall risk and advise patients in turning strategy selection.
  Objectives
  To enhance understanding of PD turning strategies and determine if turning can be assessed using a video-recording and categorization method, we compared 180-degree and 90-degree turns as a function of medication status and dual-tasking (DT).
  Methods
  21 PD participants (H&Y stage 1--3) in PD-ON and PD-OFF medication states and 16 controls completed 180-degree and 90-degree turn-tasks with and without DT. Video-recordings of tasks permitted classification of 180-degree turns into Few-Step turns (FST) vs. Multi-Step turns (MST) and 90-degree turns into Step vs. Spin-turns. FST were further sub-classified into Twisting vs. Sideways turns and MST into Backward, Festination, Forward or Wheeling turns. Percentages of subtypes were analyzed across groups by task.
  Results
  IN 180-degree tasks, there was an effect of group: FST vs. MST F(2,55)â€¯=â€¯9.578, pâ€¯<â€¯.001. PD participants in the off-medication state (PD-OFF) produced significantly more MST with a larger number of different turning subtypes vs. controls or PD on medication (PD-ON). In 90-degree tasks, controls significantly increased their proportion of Step-turns while DT (pâ€¯<â€¯.001), an adaptation not observed in PD-ON or PD-OFF.
  Conclusions
  PD turning impairments may stem from an inability to select a unified turning strategy and to adapt to the turning environment, which may be exacerbated in PD-OFF.

  When older adults turn to sit, about 80% of the subjects complete the turn before starting to sit i.e., a distinct-strategy, while in about 20%, part of the turning and sitting take place concurrently, i.e., an overlapping-strategy. A prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlap interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) are related to worse motor symptoms and poorer cognition. In the present study, we evaluated what strategy is employed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) when they transition from turning to sitting.
  Methods
  96 participants with PD performed turn to sit as part of the Timed Up and Go test, both with and without medications, while wearing a body-fixed sensor. We quantified the turn-to-sit transition and determined which strategy (distinct or overlapping) was employed. We then stratified the cases and used regression models adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight to examine the associations of the D-interval or O-interval with parkinsonian features and cognition.
  Results
  Most patients (66%) employed the overlapping-strategy, both off and on anti-parkinsonian medications. Longer O-intervals were associated with longer duration of PD, more severe PD motor symptoms, a higher postural-instability-gait-disturbance (PIGD) score, and worse Freezing of gait. Longer D-intervals were not associated with disease duration or PD motor symptoms. Neither the D- nor O-intervals were related to cognitive function. Individuals who employed the overlapping-strategy had more severe postural instability (i.e., higher PIGD scores), as compared to those who used the distinct-strategy.
  Significance
  In contrast to older adults without PD, most patients with PD utilize the overlapping strategy. Poorer postural and gait control are associated with the strategy choice and with the duration of concurrent performance of turning and sitting. Additional work is needed to further explicate the mechanisms underlying these strategies and their clinical implications.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait,Balance",Wearable,,IMU,100,j.gaitpost.2018.10.018,Research Article,Also Predicting Response to Treatment

However, no work has analyzed in detail the importance of the different phonemes in the automatic detection of PD from the speech. This work proposes new approaches for this detection by using new classification schemes that allow to compare independently the different phonetic units of patients and controls employed during several speech tasks. Three different parkinsonian corpora were used allowing cross-validation and cross-corpora trials. The results of cross-validation trials (k-folds) provided accuracies between 81% and 94%, with AUC between 0.87 and 0.97 depending on the corpus, while cross-corpora trials yielded accuracies between 66% and 76% with AUC between 0.76 and 0.87. These results suggest that PD affects to the articulatory sequence as a whole, influencing more clearly phonetic units requiring a higher narrowing of the vocal tract. Additionally, text-dependent utterances are considered as the recommended speech task for the detection of PD in this type of schemes as these allow to compare more precisely the phonetic units of patients and controls. Lastly, this work discusses the existence of a glass ceiling in the accuracy of the systems for the automatic detection of PD using speech, concluding that this is below 95% for most of the cases.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.bspc.2018.10.020,Research Article,

As approximately 90% percent of PD patients exhibit some form of vocal disorders in the earlier stages of the disease, the recent PD telediagnosis studies focus on the detection of the vocal impairments from sustained vowel phonations or running speech of the subjects. In these studies, various speech signal processing algorithms have been used to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment, and the calculated features were fed to learning algorithms to construct reliable decision support systems. In this study, we apply, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to the voice signals of PD patients for feature extraction, which has higher frequency resolution than the classical discrete wavelet transform. We compare the effectiveness of TQWT with the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods used in diagnosis of PD from vocal disorders. For this purpose, we have collected the voice recordings of 252 subjects in the context of this study and extracted multiple feature subsets from the voice recordings. The feature subsets are fed to multiple classifiers and the predictions of the classifiers are combined with ensemble learning approaches. The results show that TQWT performs better or comparable to the state-of-the-art speech signal processing techniques used in PD classification. We also find that Mel-frequency cepstral and the tunable-Q wavelet coefficients, which give the highest accuracies, contain complementary information in PD classification problem resulting in an improved system when combined using a filter feature selection technique.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.asoc.2018.10.022,Research Article,

  Cortical dysfunctioning significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).
  Objective
  We aimed at testing whether an acute levodopa administration has measurable and specific cortical effects possibly related to striatal dopaminergic deficit.
  Methods
  In thirteen PD patients, we measured the electroencephalographic responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS/EEG) of the supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobule (nâ€¯=â€¯8) before and after an acute intake of levodopa. We also performed a single-photon emission computed tomography and [123I]N-Ï‰-fluoropropyl-2Î²-carbomethoxy-3Î²-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane to identify the more affected and the less affected brain side in each patient, according to the dopaminergic innervation loss of the putamen. Cortical excitability changes before and after an acute intake of levodopa were computed and compared between the more and the less affected brain side at the single-patient as well as at the group level.
  Results
  We found that levodopa intake induces a significant increase (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.01) of cortical excitability nearby the supplementary motor area in the more affected brain side, greater (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.025) than in the less affected brain side. Notably, cortical excitability changes nearby the superior parietal lobule were not statistically significant.
  Conclusions
  These results strengthen the idea that dysfunction of specific cortico-subcortical circuits may contribute to pathophysiology of PD symptoms.

Gait signal is one of the best features to characterize and detect movement disorders caused by a malfunction in parts of the brain and nervous system of the patients with PD. Various classification approaches using spatiotemporal gait variables have been presented earlier to classify Parkinson's gait. In this study we propose a novel method for gait pattern classification between patients with PD and healthy controls, based upon phase space reconstruction (PSR), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and neural networks. First, vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs) at specific positions of human feet are captured and then phase space is reconstructed. The properties associated with the gait system dynamics are preserved in the reconstructed phase space. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been used. These measured parameters demonstrate significant difference in gait dynamics between the two groups and have been utilized to form a reference variable set. Second, reference variables are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and the third IMFs are extracted and served as gait features. Third, neural networks are then used as the classifier to distinguish between patients with PD and healthy controls based on the difference of gait dynamics preserved in the gait features between the two groups. Finally, experiments are carried out on 93 PD patients and 73 healthy subjects to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using 2-fold, 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation styles, the correct classification rates are reported to be 91.46%, 96.99% and 98.80%, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic and non-invasive classification between patients with PD and healthy subjects.",>30,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,Force sensor,uk,j.neunet.2018.12.012,Research Article,

  Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders that affect neurons in the brain resulting in a debilitating condition and progressive degeneration of nerve cells. These diseases involve different aspects among which speech impairment. Vocal signal analysis is used to evaluate this impairment and to discriminate normal from pathological voices.
  Materials and methods
  In this paper, two methods of vocal signal analysis have been proposed to evaluate an anomalous condition in human speech, known as dysarthria, useful to compare pathological and healthy voices. Parkinson and Multiple Sclerosis disease have been considered and patients affected by both pathologies have been enrolled. The methods have been tested on 153 voice signals belonging to: 39 healthy subjects (HS), 60 patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and 54 patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Acoustic (F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR) and vowel metric (tVSA, qVSA, FCR) features have been extracted.
  Results
  The results report significant differences in almost all of these features in pathological and healthy voices by performing statistical tests. F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR, tVSA and FCR are statistically significant features thus they can be used as indicators in the diagnosis of dysarthria-related diseases such as in PD and MS. The results suggest that the applied methodologies are efficient and useful in characterizing the different behavior of vocal signal in healthy and pathological subjects. Consequently, they could be a valid support for physicians in disease evaluation and progression monitoring.
  Conclusions
  The contribution aims to evaluate, support and diagnose the comorbidity in pathological patients verifying the co-occurrence of speech and neurological disorders in the same individual. The proposed solution is studied and implemented to be efficient and low cost following the model of precision medicine to customize clinical practice in disease diagnosis and treatment.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.ijmedinf.2018.11.008,Research Article,Also Prognosis/Monitoring of Disease

  A style of dance called tango translates clinical practice into a new philosophy and rehabilitative approach for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). The style of dance mixes music, self-generated and external cued strategies and social and emotional recovery. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies reporting health benefits for people diagnosed with PD who dance tango. However, there are some organisational limitations to people participating in dance classes, including having trained Tango teachers, an appropriate space for dancing, and schedule that allows for participants with motor inabilities.

Pathological attenuation of the right prefrontal cortex activity predicts speech and limb motor timing disorder in Parkinson's disease,"Behroozmand, Roozbeh; Johari, Karim",2019,Behavioural Brain Research,"Parkinson's disease, Speech production, Limb movement, Movement disorder, Reaction time, Event-related potentials","Neurological deficits can cause a wide range of motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, our understanding about the effects of PD on the underlying neural mechanisms of motor function has remained elusive. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between PD pathology and neurological deficits in planning and execution mechanisms of motor timing during speech production and limb movement. We used a combination of behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures to characterize motor timing deficits in patients with PD compared with a neurologically intact matched control group during randomized speech vowel vocalization and button press motor reaction time tasks in response to temporally predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli. Behavioral results indicated slower motor reaction times in PD regardless of motor modality or temporal predictability of sensory stimuli. In addition, our analysis indicated that slower motor reaction times in PD were correlated with pathological attenuation of neural activities within the right precentral and inferior frontal cortex only before the onset of speech production and limb movement. These findings highlight the role of a right-lateralized prefrontal cortical network in motor planning and its relationship with PD pathology during speech and limb movement timing control. Based on these data, we suggest that pathological attenuation of neural activities within this network is a neurophysiological biomarker of general and modality non-specific motor timing deficits in PD. We propose that this right-lateralized prefrontal network is a potential candidate for targeted treatment of speech and limb motor timing disorders in patients with PD.",,,Rehabilitation,speech and limb motor timing,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

The aim of this pilot study was to examine PFC activity during turning in PD and healthy controls, and to investigate the association between PFC activity and turning. Thirty-two subjects, 15 freezers (PD + FoG) and 17 non-freezers (PD Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ FoG), and 8 controls were asked to perform a 2-min turning-in-place test under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions.

Our results show a significant group (p = .050), task (p = .039), and interaction (p = .047) for the PFC activity during turning. Specifically, PD + FoG show higher PFC during turning compared to the other groups; PFC activity during DT is overall different compared to ST with an opposite trend in PD + FoG compared to controls and PD Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ FoG.

  Turning is impaired in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and it is a common trigger for Freezing of gait (FoG). Recent evidence suggests that people with PD who freeze (PD+FoG) have worse turning performance than those who don't have freezing (non-freezers, PD-FoG), and the freezing episodes are exacerbated by increasing the turn angular amplitude.
  Research question
  We investigated the difference between turning 180Ã‚Â° while walking versus turning 360Ã‚Â° in place, in both single- and dual-task conditions, by means of objective measures in people with PD with and without FoG.
  Methods
  Twenty-four PD+FoG and eighteen PD-FoG performed 180Ã‚Â° turns while walking and 360Ã‚Â° turns in place during single- and dual-task conditions. Quantitative measures of turning and the dual-task cost were computed. Differences were investigated between groups and within turning types using ANOVA. Associations between turn measures and clinical scales were examined with Spearman correlations.
  Results
  Turn duration and the number of steps were greater, and peak angular velocity slower, in PD+FoG compared to PD-FoG (p < 0.001). Dual-task costs were similar across groups, but turn duration showed significant interaction (p = 0.03).

  Clinical assessment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is subjective and may not reflect patient real-world experience. This two-part pilot study evaluated the accuracy of the NIMBLE wearable biosensor patch (containing an accelerometer and electromyography sensor) to record body movements in clinic and home environments versus clinical measurement of motor symptoms.
  Methods
  Patients (Hoehn & Yahr 2-3) had motor symptom fluctuations and were on a stable levodopa dose. Part 1 investigated different sensor body locations (six patients). In Part 2, 21 patients wore four sensors (chest, and most affected side of shin, forearm and back-of-hand) during a 2-day clinic- and 1-day home-based evaluation. Patients underwent Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale assessments on days 1-2, and performed pre-defined motor activities at home on day 3. An algorithm estimated motor-symptom severity (predicted scores) using patch data (in-clinic); this was compared with in-clinic motor symptom assessments (observed scores).
  Results
  The overall correlation coefficient between in-clinic observed and sensor algorithm-predicted scores was 0.471 (p = 0.031). Predicted and observed scores were identical 45% of the time, with a predicted score within a Ã‚Â±1 range 91% of the time. Exact accuracy for each activity varied, ranging from 32% (pronation/supination) to 67% (rest-tremor-amplitude). Patients rated the patch easy-to-use and as providing valuable data for managing PD symptoms. Overall patch-adhesion success was 97.2%. The patch was safe and generally well tolerated.
  Conclusions
  This study showed a correlation between sensor algorithm-predicted and clinician-observed motor-symptom scores.

Behavioral therapies, such as rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), have been developed more recently and demonstrated efficacy. However, the neural mechanisms of RAS are only vaguely understood. In this study, we examined the neurophysiology of RAS using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a sample of older adults with (21 people) and without PD (23 participants). All participants underwent high-density MEG during a beat-based cued tapping task with rhythmic and non-rhythmic patterns, and the resulting data were analyzed using a Bayesian image reconstruction method. Complex wavelet based time-frequency decomposition was used to compute inter-trial phase locking factor (PLF) to auditory stimuli for left and right signal space projection vectors. Tapping with a rhythm compared to a non-rhythmic sequence resulted in differential brain activity in each group: (i) a greater activation of temporal, motor and parietal areas was found in healthy adults; (ii) a greater reliance on parietal and frontal gyri was found in PD participants. During rhythmic tapping, older adults without PD had significantly stronger neural activity in bilateral frontal, supplementary and primary motor areas compared to those with PD. Conversely, older adults with PD exhibited significantly stronger activity in the bilateral parietal regions, as well as the rolandic operculum and bilateral supramarginal gyri, relative to their healthy peers. These data suggest that RAS mobilizes diverse oscillatory networks; Healthy controls may shift to frontal areas mobilization whereas PD patients rely on parietal areas to a greater extent, which may reflect frontal network dysfunction with compensation in PD, and could serve as specific regions of interest for further RAS studies.",,,Rehabilitation,Motor symptoms,BioPotential,,MEG,,,,
Upper body accelerations as a biomarker of gait impairment in the early stages of Parkinson's disease,"Buckley, Christopher; Galna, Brook; Rochester, Lynn; MazzÃƒÂ , Claudia",2019,Gait & Posture,"Gait analysis, Accelerometers, Harmonic ratio, Balance, Head and pelvis, Human movement","Background
  Changes in upper body (UB) motion during gait may be a marker of incipient pathology, intervention response and disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD), which if independent from the lower body motion, might provide an improved assessment of gait.
  Research question
  This study aimed to test this hypothesis and establish whether variables calculated from accelerations measured on the UB are unique from spatiotemporal characteristics and can contribute to an improved classification of PD gait.
  Methods
  Data was obtained from 70 people with PD (69.2 Ã‚Â± 9.9 y.o., UPDRS III: 36.9 Ã‚Â± 12.3) and 64 age-matched controls (71.6 Ã‚Â± 6.8 y.o.). Spatiotemporal characteristics were measured using a pressure sensitive mat (GAITRite). Head and pelvis accelerations were synchronously measured with wearable inertial sensors (Opal, APDM). Pearson's product-moment correlations were calculated between 49 selected variables from UB accelerations (representing magnitude, smoothness, regularity, symmetry and attenuation) and 16 traditional spatiotemporal characteristics (representing pace, variability, rhythm, asymmetry and postural control). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to test the variables ability to classify PD gait.
  Results
  The variables were mostly unique from each other (67% of variables recorded an r < 0.3). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that UB variables were moderately better at classifying PD gait than the spatiotemporal characteristics (Univariate: 0.70 to 0.81, Multivariate: 0.88 to 0.91 AUC).
  Significance
  This study showed for the first time that, if aiming at objective and optimal sensitive biomarkers for PD, UB variables should be measured in conjunction with spatiotemporal characteristics to obtain a more holistic assessment of PD gait for use in a clinical or free-living environment.",,,Diagnosis,Gait analysis,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

The new algorithm which is based on the Cognitive Extreme Learning Machines (CELM) has been implemented for the classification of different facial expressions in accordance with the symptoms of the diseases and relates the results for their diagnosis. Again, the Cognitive Rule Engine has been used for the incorporation for the predetermination and diagnosis. The proposed method has been compared with the existing intelligent learning algorithms and the results are proved to be more accurate in terms of the recognition rate, and training speed.",,,Diagnosis,Facial expressions,Images,,Images,,,,
Upper limb motor pre-clinical assessment in Parkinson's disease using machine learning,"Cavallo, Filippo; Moschetti, Alessandra; Esposito, Dario; Maremmani, Carlo; Rovini, Erika",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Decision support systems, Idiopathic hyposmia, Inertial wearable sensors, Machine learning, Motor pre-clinical symptoms, Prodromal phase, Parkinson's disease","Introduction
  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by disabling motor and non-motor symptoms. For example, idiopathic hyposmia (IH), which is a reduced olfactory sensitivity, is typical in >95% of PD patients and is a preclinical marker for the pathology.
  Methods
  In this work, a wearable inertial device, named SensHand V1, was used to acquire motion data from the upper limbs during the performance of six tasks selected by MDS-UPDRS III. Three groups of people were enrolled, including 30 healthy subjects, 30 IH people, and 30 PD patients. Forty-eight parameters per side were computed by spatiotemporal and frequency data analysis. A feature array was selected as the most significant to discriminate among the different classes both in two-group and three-group classification. Multiple analyses were performed comparing three supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and NaÃ¯ve Bayes, on three different datasets.
  Results
  Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (F-Measure 0.95 for RF and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including subjects with hyposmia as a separate group (0.79 accuracy, 0.80 precision with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, RF classifiers were the best approach for this application.
  Conclusion
  The system is suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis. Further, combining motion analysis with a validated olfactory screening test, a two-step non-invasive, low-cost procedure can be defined to appropriately analyze people at risk for PD development, helping clinicians to identify also subtle changes in motor performance that characterize PD onset.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Wearable,,IMU,,,,
Phase lag index and spectral power as QEEG features for identification of patients with mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,"Chaturvedi, Menorca; Bogaarts, Jan Guy; (Cozac), Vitalii V. Kozak; Hatz, Florian; Gschwandtner, Ute; Meyer, Antonia; Fuhr, Peter; Roth, Volker",2019,Clinical Neurophysiology,"Parkinson's disease, QEEG, Connectivity, Spectral power, Mild cognitive impairment, Machine learning","Objectives
  To identify quantitative EEG frequency and connectivity features (Phase Lag Index) characteristic of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and to investigate if these features correlate with cognitive measures of the patients.
  Methods
  We recorded EEG data for a group of PD patients with MCI (n = 27) and PD patients without cognitive impairment (n = 43) using a high-resolution recording system. The EEG files were processed and 66 frequency along with 330 connectivity (phase lag index, PLI) measures were calculated. These measures were used to classify MCI vs. MCI-free patients. We also assessed correlations of these features with cognitive tests based on comprehensive scores (domains).
  Results
  PLI measures classified PD-MCI from non-MCI patients better than frequency measures. PLI in delta, theta band had highest importance for identifying patients with MCI. Amongst cognitive domains, we identified the most significant correlations between Memory and Theta PLI, Attention and Beta PLI.
  Conclusion
  PLI is an effective quantitative EEG measure to identify PD patients with MCI.
  Significance
  We identified quantitative EEG measures which are important for early identification of cognitive decline in PD.",20<n<=30,Laboratory,Diagnosis,Cognitive activity,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,
Physiological complexity of gait between regular and non-exercisers with Parkinson's disease,"Combs-Miller, Stephanie A.; Dugan, Eric L.; Beachy, Ann; Derby, Brook B.; Hosinski, Alicia L.; Robbins, Kristen",2019,Clinical Biomechanics,"Entropy, Exercise, Boxing, Antiparkinson agents, Parkinson's disease","Background
  Physiological complexity represents overall health of a system and its underlying capacity to adapt to stresses. The primary purpose of this study was to determine if physiological complexity of gait both ON and OFF anti-Parkinson medication differed between regular and non-exercisers with Parkinson's disease.
  Methods
  Twenty participants with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were enrolled in this cross-sectional study (regular exercisers n = 10, non-exercisers n = 10). Two data collection sessions were completed during a single visit, first after a 12-hour overnight withdrawal from anti-Parkinson medications (OFF), and again one-hour after taking anti-Parkinson medications (ON). During each session participants completed a 2-minute walking task at their preferred pace while wearing wireless inertial measurement units on each lower extremity segment (thigh, shank, foot). Multivariate multiscale entropy was calculated from the tri-axial accelerometer signals and converted to a complexity index for analysis.
  Findings
  Regular exercisers demonstrated significantly higher complexity indices ON and OFF anti-Parkinson medications compared to non-exercisers (ON F = 3.84 P = 0.02; OFF F = 3.61, P < 0.03). Regular exercisers did not significantly differ in complexity between OFF and ON states (most affected leg F = 0.15 P = 0.71; least affected leg F = 0.30 P = 0.60), but non-exercisers demonstrated significantly decreased complexity in the least affected leg OFF anti-Parkinson medications (F = 5.17 P < 0.04).
  Interpretation
  Enhanced gait complexity in the regular exercisers may indicate that ongoing exercise is a key ingredient contributing to health in persons with Parkinson's disease. Exercising on a regular basis with Parkinson's disease may augment one's ability to adapt to barriers encountered during gait regardless of medication state.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait,Wearable,,IMU,,,,
Aberrant resting-state oscillatory brain activity in Parkinson's disease patients with visual hallucinations: An MEG source-space study,"Dauwan, M.; Hoff, J. I.; Vriens, E. M.; Hillebrand, A.; Stam, C. J.; Sommer, I. E.",2019,NeuroImage: Clinical,"MEG, Visual hallucinations, Multimodal hallucinations, Cholinergic dysfunction, Parkinson's disease","To gain insight into possible underlying mechanism(s) of visual hallucinations (VH) in Parkinson's disease (PD), we explored changes in local oscillatory activity in different frequency bands with source-space magnetoencephalography (MEG). Eyes-closed resting-state MEG recordings were obtained from 20 PD patients with hallucinations (Hall+) and 20 PD patients without hallucinations (Hall-), matched for age, gender and disease severity. The Hall+ group was subdivided into 10 patients with VH only (unimodal Hall+) and 10 patients with multimodal hallucinations (multimodal Hall+). Subsequently, neuronal activity at source-level was reconstructed using an atlas-based beamforming approach resulting in source-space time series for 78 cortical and 12 subcortical regions of interest in the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. Peak frequency (PF) and relative power in six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta and gamma) were compared between Hall+ and Hall-, unimodal Hall+ and Hall-, multimodal Hall+ and Hall-, and unimodal Hall+ and multimodal Hall+ patients. PF and relative power per frequency band did not differ between Hall+ and Hall-, and multimodal Hall+ and Hall- patients. Compared to the Hall- group, unimodal Hall+ patients showed significantly higher relative power in the theta band (p = 0.005), and significantly lower relative power in the beta (p = 0.029) and gamma (p = 0.007) band, and lower PF (p = 0.011). Compared to the unimodal Hall+, multimodal Hall+ showed significantly higher PF (p = 0.007). In conclusion, a subset of PD patients with only VH showed slowing of MEG-based resting-state brain activity with an increase in theta activity, and a concomitant decrease in beta and gamma activity, which could indicate central cholinergic dysfunction as underlying mechanism of VH in PD. This signature was absent in PD patients with multimodal hallucinations.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,EEG abnormalities,BioPotential,,MEG,,,,
Personalized transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and physical therapy to treat motor and cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease: A randomized cross-over trial,"Felice, Alessandra Del; Castiglia, Leonora; Formaggio, Emanuela; Cattelan, Manuela; Scarpa, Bruno; Manganotti, Paolo; Tenconi, Elena; Masiero, Stefano",2019,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Neurotherapeutic target, Electroencephalography, Neurophysiology, Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS III), Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)","Abnormal cortical oscillations are markers of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can modulate brain oscillations and possibly impact on behaviour. Mapping of cortical activity (prevalent oscillatory frequency and topographic scalp distribution) may provide a personalized neurotherapeutic target and guide non-invasive brain stimulation. This is a cross-over, double blinded, randomized trial. Electroencephalogram (EEG) from participants with PD referred to Specialist Clinic, University Hospital, were recorded. TACS frequency and electrode position were individually defined based on statistical comparison of EEG power spectra maps with normative data from our laboratory. Stimulation frequency was set according to the EEG band displaying higher power spectra (with beta excess on EEG map, tACS was set at 4 Hz; with theta excess, tACS was set at 30 Hz). Participants were randomized to tACS or random noise stimulation (RNS), 5 days/week for 2-weeks followed by ad hoc physical therapy. EEG, motor (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor: UPDRS III), neuropsychological (frontal, executive and memory tests) performance and mood were measured before (T0), after (T1) and 4-weeks after treatment (T2). A linear model with random effects and Wilcoxon test were used to detect differences. Main results include a reduction of beta rhythm in theta-tACS vs. RNS group at T1 over right sensorimotor area (p = .014) and left parietal area (p = .010) and at T2 over right sensorimotor area (p = .004) and left frontal area (p = .039). Bradykinesia items improved at T1 (p = .002) and T2 (p = .047) compared to T0 in the tACS group. In the tACS group the MontrÃ©al Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) improved at T2 compared with T1 (p = .049). Individualized tACS in PD improves motor and cognitive performance.

Dynamically enhanced static handwriting representation for Parkinson's disease detection,"Diaz, Moises; Ferrer, Miguel Angel; Impedovo, Donato; Pirlo, Giuseppe; Vessio, Gennaro",2019,Pattern Recognition Letters,"Parkinson's disease, e-Health, Computer aided diagnosis, Dynamically enhanced static handwriting, Convolutional neural networks","Computer aided diagnosis systems can provide non-invasive, low-cost tools to support clinicians. These systems have the potential to assist the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease (PD). Handwriting plays a special role in the context of PD assessment. In this paper, the discriminating power of ""dynamically enhanced""Â static images of handwriting is investigated. The enhanced images are synthetically generated by exploiting simultaneously the static and dynamic properties of handwriting. Specifically, we propose a static representation that embeds dynamic information based on: (i) drawing the points of the samples, instead of linking them, so as to retain temporal/velocity information; and (ii) adding pen-ups for the same purpose. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new handwriting representation, a fair comparison between this approach and state-of-the-art methods based on static and dynamic handwriting is conducted on the same dataset, i.e. PaHaW. The classification workflow employs transfer learning to extract meaningful features from multiple representations of the input data. An ensemble of different classifiers is used to achieve the final predictions. Dynamically enhanced static handwriting is able to outperform the results obtained by using static and dynamic handwriting separately.",,,Diagnosis,Handwriting,Images,,Camera,,,,
Gait stride-to-stride variability and foot clearance pattern analysis in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease and Vascular Parkinsonism,"Ferreira, Flora; Gago, Miguel F.; Bicho, Estela; Carvalho, Catarina; Mollaei, Nafiseh; Rodrigues, Lurdes; Sousa, Nuno; Rodrigues, Pedro Pereira; Ferreira, Carlos; Gama, JoÃ£o",2019,Journal of Biomechanics,"Vascular Parkinsonism, Idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Toe and heel clearance, Short and long-term gait variability, Levodopa","The literature on gait analysis in Vascular Parkinsonism (VaP), addressing issues such as variability, foot clearance patterns, and the effect of levodopa, is scarce. This study investigates whether spatiotemporal, foot clearance and stride-to-stride variability analysis can discriminate VaP, and responsiveness to levodopa. Fifteen healthy subjects, 15 Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) patients and 15 VaP patients, were assessed in two phases: before (Off-state), and one hour after (On-state) the acute administration of a suprathreshold (1.5 times the usual) levodopa dose. Participants were asked to walk a 30-meter continuous course at a self-selected walking speed while wearing foot-worn inertial sensors. For each gait variable, mean, coefficient of variation (CV), and standard deviations SD1 and SD2 obtained by PoincarÃ© analysis were calculated. General linear models (GLMs) were used to identify group differences. Patients were subject to neuropsychological evaluation (MoCA test) and Brain MRI. VaP patients presented lower mean stride velocity, stride length, lift-off and strike angle, and height of maximum toe (later swing) (p < .05), and higher %gait cycle in double support, with only the latter unresponsive to levodopa. VaP patients also presented higher CV, significantly reduced after levodopa. Yet, all VaP versus IPD differences lost significance when accounting for mean stride length as a covariate. In conclusion, VaP patients presented a unique gait with reduced degrees of foot clearance, probably correlated to vascular lesioning in dopaminergic/non-dopaminergic cortical and subcortical non-dopaminergic networks, still amenable to benefit from levodopa. The dependency of gait and foot clearance and variability deficits from stride length deserves future clarification.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Gait,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

Force adjustments were accompanied by beta power suppression irrespective of whether the force was increased or reduced. Before the adjustment was completed, beta activity returned. High beta power was specifically associated with slowing of the force adjustment. ON medication, the peak force rate was faster and cortico-basal ganglia beta phase coupling was more readily modulated. In particular, phase decoupling was stronger during faster adjustments. The results suggest that beta power in the basal ganglia does not covary with force per se, but rather with a related factor, the absolute force rate, or a more general concept of movement effort. The results also highlight that beta activity reappears during stabilization of isometric contractions, and that dopamine-related suppression of cortico-basal ganglia beta coupling is linked to faster force adjustments.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,EEG abnormalities,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

  To investigate differences in surface electromyography (EMG) features in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and aged-matched controls.
  Methods
  Surface EMG was recorded during isometric leg extension in PD patients prior to, and after undergoing a locomotor training programme, and in aged-matched controls. Differences in EMG structure were quantified using determinism (%DET), sample entropy (SampEn) and intermuscular coherence.
  Results
  %DET was significantly higher, and SampEn significantly lower, in PD patients. Intermuscular coherence was also significantly higher in the PD group in theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. %DET increased and SampEn decreased with increasing Movement-Disorder-Society UPDRS scores, while theta band coherence was significantly correlated with total MDS-UPDRS scores and torque variance. Neither %DET, SampEn nor intermuscular coherence changed in response to training.
  Conclusions
  The differences observed are consistent with increased synchrony among motor units within and across leg muscles in PD. Differences between EMG signals recorded from the PD and control groups persisted post-therapy, after improvements in walking capacity occurred.

  Recent work suggests that wearables can augment conventional measures of Parkinson's disease (PD). We evaluated the relationship between conventional measures of disease and motor severity (e.g., MDS-UPDRS part III), laboratory-based measures of gait and balance, and daily-living physical activity measures in patients with PD.
  Methods
  Data from 125 patients (age: 71.7 Ã‚Â± 6.5 years, Hoehn and Yahr: 1-3, 60.5% men) were analyzed. The MDS-UPDRS-part III was used as the gold standard of motor symptom severity. Gait and balance were quantified in the laboratory. Daily-living gait and physical activity metrics were extracted from an accelerometer worn on the lower back for 7 days.
  Results
  In multivariate analyses, daily-living physical activity and gait metrics, laboratory-based balance, demographics and subject characteristics together explained 46% of the variance in MDS-UPDRS-part III scores. Daily-living measures accounted for 62% of the explained variance, laboratory measures 30%, and demographics and subject characteristics 7% of the explained variance. Conversely, demographics and subject characteristics, laboratory-based measures of gait symmetry, and motor symptom severity together explained less than 30% of the variance in total daily-living physical activity. MDS-UPDRS-part III scores accounted for 13% of the explained variance, i.e., <4% of all the variance in total daily-living activity.
  Conclusions
  Our findings suggest that conventional measures of motor symptom severity do not strongly reflect daily-living activity and that daily-living measures apparently provide important information that is not captured in a conventional one-time, laboratory assessment of gait, balance or the MDS-UPDRS. To provide a more complete evaluation, wearable devices should be considered.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait, Physical Activity",Wearable,,IMU,,,,
Spin turns in advanced Parkinson's disease: A new clinical gait sign?,"Gavriliuc, Olga; Paschen, Steffen; Andrusca, Alexandru; Berg, Daniela; Schlenstedt, Christian; Deuschl, GÃ¼nther",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Parkinson's disease, Turning strategy, Deep brain stimulation","Objective
  Two strategies are known for turning while walking: step turns (the direction change is performed with 3 steps or more) and spin turns (turning on one/both feet simultaneously). It is unknown which strategy patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) choose and if l-dopa and STN-DBS are influencing this strategy.
  Methods
  Video-recordings of 171 PD patients that completed 180Ã‚Â° turns were analyzed by two blinded raters before surgery, both off and on l-dopa, and one year after STN-DBS-implantation. The strategies were classified: 1) spin 2) step and 3) mixed (spin plus step) strategy. The characteristics of the patients with different strategies were compared.
  Results
  Interrater reliability for classification of turning strategy showed high agreement (ÃŽÂº = 0.894). The distribution of the preferred strategy differed significantly between treatment conditions (untreated, treated with l-dopa, l-dopa plus stimulation; X2(4) = 67.2, p < 0.0001). The spin turn was found in 10.5% of patients OFF-drug, 23.5% ON-drug and in 38.8% ON-drug/ON-stim condition. In the three treatment conditions patients with spin turns had significantly lower UPDRS III scores compared to people with step turns (p = 0.017, p = 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively); step turn patients had poorer postural instability and gait disorders (PIGD) scores (p = 0.04, p = 0.002, p = 0.04, respectively).
  Conclusion
  The turn strategy can be reliably identified in clinical settings and is a simple motor sign. The spin turn is associated with better motor performance. Since improvements in motor score in patients with fluctuations are also related to behavioral changes, we cannot exclude that the turn strategy also represents a feature of psycho-motor interaction.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Gait,Video Recording,,Camera,,,,

Brain responses recorded via the 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system in an electromagnetically and acoustically isolated room. The auditory stimuli (1500 Hz, 60 dB SPL, 500 ms) were delivered to the subjects via a headphone. The inter-stimulus interval was ranged between 2.5-4.5 s. The peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes were measured in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands on 11 electrodes (including the frontal, central and parietal areas) for the statistical analysis in which one-way ANOVA test was employed for the comparisons between PD and HC. For the delta oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in frontal, central and parietal areas in comparison with HC. For the theta and alpha oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in parietal areas in comparison with HC. As a result, amplitudes of brain oscillatory responses in PD group were significantly bigger than the HC. In this context, decreased inhibitory mechanisms of cortical auditory processing due to the dysfunction of the dopaminergic activity may lead the increased evoked responses in PD group.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,,BioPotential,Cueing,"EEG, Audio Cueing",,,,

  A precise understanding of the neuronal circuits involved in the control of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) for gait initiation is missing. Neurostimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) provides a method of modulating APAs to gain insight into the underlying circuitry.
  Objective
  Our objective was to investigate if APA kinematics for step initiation could be modulated by high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in people with PD and Freezing of gait (FoG).
  Methods
  We studied 14 people with PD and FoG using neurostimulation of the STN and SNr areas after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication on the instrumented stand and walk test. We tested patients in the following randomized conditions: 'off stimulation', 'STN' stimulation (only), and 'SNr' stimulation (only). Patients were blinded to the stimulation condition. The APAs were recorded with inertial sensors and processed offline. Moreover, we assessed clinical scores with respect to motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, executive function, and FoG.
  Results
  SNr but not STN stimulation modulated the anterio-posterior size of APA. The SNr modulation of APA was associated with the stimulation effect on FoG (trend; r = 0.580, P = 0.102). The APA modulation was not correlated with any other cognitive or clinical measures.
  Conclusion
  Neuromodulation of the SNr but not of the STN modulated APAs in PD patients with FoG. The different effects of STN or SNr on the kinematic parameters of APA support the concept of segregate targets in order to address diverse kinematic components of PD gait.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,"Freezing of gait, motor symptoms",Wearable,,IMU,,,,

  Motor fluctuations between akinetic (medication OFF) and mobile phases (medication ON) states are one of the most prevalent complications of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). There is a need for a technology-based system to provide reliable information about the duration in different medication phases that can be used by the treating physician to successfully adjust therapy.
  Methods
  Two KinetiSense motion sensors were mounted on the most affected wrist and ankle of 19 PD subjects (age: 42-77, 14 males) and collected movement signals as the participants performed seven daily living activities in their medication OFF and ON phases. A feature selection and a classification algorithm based on support vector machine with fuzzy labeling was developed to detect medication ON/OFF states using gyroscope signals. The algorithm was trained using approximately 15% of the data from four activities and tested on the remaining data.
  Results
  The algorithm was able to detect medication ON and OFF states with 90.5% accuracy, 94.2% sensitivity, and 85.4% specificity. It performed equally well for all the activities with an average accuracy of 91.3% for the activities that were used in the training phase and 88.4% for the new activities.

  Feedback from wearable biosensors may help assess motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and titrate medication. Kinesia 360 continuously monitors motor symptoms via wrist and ankle sensors.
  Methods
  PD0049 was a 12-week pilot study to investigate whether using Kinesia 360 at home could improve motor symptom management in PD patients starting transdermal dopamine agonist rotigotine. Adults with PD and insufficiently controlled motor symptoms (prescribed rotigotine) were randomized 1:1 to Control Group (CG) or Experimental Group (EG) before starting rotigotine. Motor symptoms were assessed in all patients at baseline and Week 12 (W12) using Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) III and Kinesia ONE, which measures standardized motor tasks via a sensor on the index finger. Between baseline and W12, EG used Kinesia 360 at home; clinicians used the data to supplement standard care in adjusting rotigotine dosage.
  Results
  At W12, least squares mean improvements in UPDRS II (Ã¢ÂˆÂ’2.1 vs 0.5, p = 0.004) and UPDRS III (Ã¢ÂˆÂ’5.3 vs Ã¢ÂˆÂ’1.0, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.134) were clinically meaningfully greater, and mean rotigotine dosage higher (4.8 vs 3.9 mg/24Ã‚Â h) in EG (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19) vs CG (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 20). Mean rotigotine dosage increase (+2.8 vsÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â 1.9 mg/24Ã‚Â h) and mean number of dosage changes (2.8 vs 1.8) during the study were higher in EG vs CG.

An effective method to probe cognitive processing deficits in PD is the examination of brain activity during emotional processes, particularly in explicit language emotion recognition contexts.
  Methods
  The present study utilised cortical source imaging of event related potentials (ERP) from electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate valence judgements on negative and neutral target words in an automatic affective priming paradigm. Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed affective priming tasks during EEG monitoring. Cognitive impairment was measured using the validated Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS).
  Results
  Results reveal that compared to healthy age-matched controls, PD patients demonstrate a reduced N400 activation during affective priming tasks in bilateral regions of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and, notably, have a late wave ERP component (LPP) in left MFG, present between 600 and 800 ms, following family-wise error correction (pFWE < 0.05). LPP in PD patients were significantly associated with PD-CRS scores.
  Limitations
  Although affective priming paradigms are an effective means for various domains of cognition, it is not a focused cognitive behavioural test for cognitive dysfunction. Our study is thus limited to a surrogate measure of cognitive dysfunction via examination of emotional word processing cues.
  Conclusions
  These findings suggest that source imaging methods with ERP paradigms in PD are effective in identifying delayed cognitive processes in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Cortical Activity,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,
Evaluation of a sensor algorithm for motor state rating in Parkinson's disease,"Johansson, Dongni; Thomas, Ilias; Ericsson, Anders; Johansson, Anders; Medvedev, Alexander; Memedi, Mevludin; Nyholm, Dag; Ohlsson, Fredrik; Senek, Marina; Spira, Jack; Westin, Jerker; Bergquist, Filip",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Levodopa challenge test, Independent evaluation, Wearable sensors, Parkinson's disease, Machine learning algorithms","Introduction
  A treatment response objective index (TRIS) was previously developed based on sensor data from pronation-supination tests. This study aimed to examine the performance of TRIS for medication effects in a new population sample with Parkinson's disease (PD) and its usefulness for constructing individual dose-response models.
  Methods
  Twenty-five patients with PD performed a series of tasks throughout a levodopa challenge while wearing sensors. TRIS was used to determine motor changes in pronation-supination tests following a single levodopa dose, and was compared to clinical ratings including the Treatment Response Scale (TRS) and six sub-items of the UPDRS part III.
  Results
  As expected, correlations between TRIS and clinical ratings were lower in the new population than in the initial study. TRIS was still significantly correlated to TRS (rs = 0.23, P < 0.001) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.33. For the patients (n = 17) with a good levodopa response and clear motor fluctuations, a stronger correlation was found (rs = 0.38, RMSE = 1.29, P < 0.001). The mean TRIS increased significantly when patients went from the practically defined off to their best on state (P = 0.024). Individual dose-response models could be fitted for more participants when TRIS was used for modelling than when TRS ratings were used.
  Conclusion
  The objective sensor index shows promise for constructing individual dose-response models, but further evaluations and retraining of the TRIS algorithm are desirable to improve its performance and to ensure its clinical effectiveness.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Limb movements,Wearable,,IMU,,,,
Electromyography activity level in rapid eye movement sleep predicts neurodegenerative diseases in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder: a 5-year longitudinal study,"Liu, Yaping; Zhang, Jihui; Lam, Siu Ping; Yu, Mandy Wai Man; Li, Shirley Xin; Zhou, Junying; Chan, Ngan Yin; Wang, Jing; Feng, Hongliang; Chan, Anne; Mok, Vincent; Wing, Yun Kwok",2019,Sleep Medicine,"REM sleep behavior disorder, REM sleep without atonia, Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic, Neurodegenerative diseases","Objectives
  To investigate whether baseline electromyography (EMG) activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predicts the development of neurodegenerative diseases over time in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).
  Methods
  A total of 216 patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD were recruited from September 1997 to December 2016 with a mean follow-up duration of 5.0Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 3.7 years (median: 4.0, range: 0.5-19.0). Neurodegenerative diseases were ascertained according to standard diagnostic criteria during follow-up. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to evaluate the dynamic predictive performance of EMG activity over time. Both tonic and phasic EMG activity were dichotomized into 'mild' and 'severe' categories by the ROC curves estimated optimal cut-offs.
  Results
  A total of 58 patients (26.9%) developed neurodegenerative diseases. The predictive performance of tonic EMG activity was stable (area under the curve of approximately 0.68) over time, while the performance of phasic EMG activity was significantly superior to chance only after five years of follow-up. The optimal cut-off for prediction at five years was 15.4% (sensitivity, 0.69; specificity, 0.57) and 7.8% (sensitivity, 0.79; specificity, 0.47) for tonic and phasic EMG activity, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses further revealed that severe tonic (adjusted HR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.35-5.62) and phasic EMG activity (adjusted HR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.10-8.71) were associated with early development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), respectively.
  Conclusions
  Tonic but not phasic EMG activity may serve as a stable biomarkers for predicting the progression of neurodegeneration in iRBD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Sleep topics,BioPotential,,EMG,,,,

Arm rest tremors were video filmed and scored by two independent raters using the motor subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). The tremor intensity parameter was defined by the root mean square of the angular speed measured by the smartwatch at the wrist. Sixty-four smartwatch evaluations were completed. The Spearman coefficient among the mean of the resting tremor (UPDRS-III) scores and smartwatch measurements for tremor intensity was 0.81 (p < .001); smartwatch reliability to quantify tremors was checked by intraclass reliability coefficient with a resting tremor = 0.89, minimum detectable change = 59.03%. Good acceptance of the system was shown. Smartwatch use for PD tremor analysis is possible, reliable, well-correlated with clinical scores, and well-accepted by patients for clinical follow-up.

  To investigate EEG changes during an auditory odd-ball task while walking (dual-task) in young adults, older adults, and patients with Parkinson's disease.
  Methods
  11 young adults, 10 older adults, and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) performed an auditory oddball task during standing and walking on a treadmill, while wearing a wireless EEG cap. The amplitude and latency of P300 were compared between groups and within conditions using linear mix model analysis. Gait was evaluated using wearable sensors and cognition was assessed using the Color Trail Test.
  Results
  P300 latency became longer during walking in all groups (p = 0.005). During walking, older adults (p = 0.005) and patients with PD (p = 0.001) showed prolonged P300 latency compared to young adults. Significant task by group interaction was found in P300 amplitude (p = 0.008). Patients with PD demonstrated reduced P300 amplitude during walking compared to standing (p = 0.023). Among all subjects, better motor and cognitive performance correlated with shorter P300 latency (r = 0.457, p = 0.014 and r = 0.431, p = 0.040, respectively).
  Conclusions
  These findings provide direct evidence of the physiological recruitment of attentional networks during walking and their impact by ageing and disease.

Pre-stimulus beta power modulation during motor sequence learning is reduced in 'Parkinson's disease,"Meissner, Sarah Nadine; Krause, Vanessa; SÃ¼dmeyer, Martin; Hartmann, Christian Johannes; Pollok, Bettina",2019,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Beta oscillations, SRTT, Anticipatory motor control, Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Parkinson's disease (PD)","Beta oscillations within motor-cortical areas have been linked to sensorimotor function. In line with this, pathologically altered beta activity in cortico-basal ganglia pathways has been suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by motor impairment. Although its precise function is still discussed, beta activity might subserve an anticipatory role in preparation of future actions. By reanalyzing previously published data, we aimed at investigating the role of pre-stimulus motor-cortical beta power modulation in motor sequence learning and its alteration in PD. 20 PD patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) in which reaction time gain presumably reflects the ability to anticipate subsequent sequence items. Randomly varying patterns served as control trials. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and data was reanalyzed with respect to task stimuli onset. Assuming that pre-stimulus beta power modulation is functionally related to motor sequence learning, reaction time gain due to training on the SRTT should vary depending on the amount of beta power suppression prior to stimulus onset. We hypothesized to find less pre-stimulus beta power suppression in PD patients as compared to HC associated with reduced motor sequence learning in patients. Behavioral analyses revealed that PD patients exhibited smaller reaction time gain in sequence relative to random control trials than HC indicating reduced learning in PD. This finding was indeed paralleled by reduced pre-stimulus beta power suppression in PD patients. Further strengthening its functional relevance, the amount of pre-stimulus beta power suppression during sequence training significantly predicted subsequent reaction time advantage in sequence relative to random trials in patients. In conclusion, the present data provide first evidence for the contribution of pre-stimulus motor-cortical beta power suppression to motor sequence learning and support the hypothesis that beta oscillations may subserve an anticipatory, predictive function, possibly compromised in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,gait,BioPotential,,MEG,,,,

  Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by gait disturbances, which become severe during the advanced stages of the disease. Though gait impairments in Parkinson's disease have been extensively described in terms of spatiotemporal gait parameters, little is known regarding associated patterns of cortical activity. The objective of the present study is to test if interhemispheric synchronization differs between participants with PD and healthy elderly controls (NPD). We analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded during bilateral movements, i.e., locomotion and hand tapping.
  Methods
  Fifteen participants with PD ('OFF' their anti-parkinsonian medications) and eight NPD were assessed during quiet standing, straight-line walking, turning, and hand tapping tasks. Using a 32-electrode EEG array, we quantified the synchronization in periodic cortical activation between the brain hemispheres (interhemispheric phase synchronization; inter-PS). Theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands were evaluated.
  Results
  In all bands, inter-PS was significantly higher for the PD group as compared with the NPD group during standing and walking (p < 0.001) and during bimanual tasks (p = 0.026).
  Conclusions
  Persons with PD exhibit increased inter-PS as compared with NPD participants. These findings support previous evidence from animal studies, that bilateral cortical hypersynchronization emerges from the asymmetric neural degeneration that is at the base of the disease. Future studies should elucidate the long-term temporal development of this hypersynchronization and its clinical relevance (e.g., can it 'serve' as prodromal marker?).",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,EEG abnormalities,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

  Gait and balance impairments are cardinal features of Parkinson's disease (PD) that require cognitive input. However, the extent to which specific gait and balance characteristics relate to cognition in PD is unclear. In addition, independent models of gait and balance have not been developed from the same cohort. We aimed to i) develop models of gait and balance in a large PD cohort and ii) determine which gait and balance characteristics best related to cognition.
  Methods
  One hundred and ninety-eight people with PD were recruited to the Pacific Udall Center. Using six inertial sensors (APDM, Inc.), comprehensive gait measurements were collected over a 2-min continuous walk and comprehensive static balance measures were collected during a 60-second standing task. Six domains of cognition were assessed: global cognition, attention, executive function, language, memory, and visuospatial function. Correlations and hierarchical linear regression determined independent associations.
  Results
  Principal components analysis identified a gait model containing four domains accounting for 80.1% of total variance: pace/turning, rhythm, variability, and trunk. The balance model contained four independent domains accounting for 84.5% of total variance: sway area/jerkiness, sway velocity, sway frequency anteroposterior, and sway frequency mediolateral. Gait domains of pace/turning and variability were strongly associated with attention and executive function. Sway area and jerkiness of balance associated with attention and visuospatial function.
  Conclusions
  Gait and balance characteristics were associated with specific types of cognition. The specific relationships between gait or balance with cognitive functions suggests shared cerebral cortical circuitry for mobility and cognitive functions.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait, Balance",Wearable,,IMU sensors(APDM: Gyroscope + accelerometer),,,,

This methodology entails extracting feature sets of a recorded person's voice then utilizing a machine learning technique to identify the healthy and Parkinson's cases from the voice. This paper attempts to improve the diagnoses of Parkinson's disease by testing multiple feature evaluation and classification machine learning methods based on the voice disorders analysis. The aim of this paper is to find the optimal solution to the problem by (i) proposing a new Multiple Feature Evaluation Approach (MFEA) of a multi-agent system (ii) implementing five independent classification schemas which are Decision Tree, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machine on the Parkinson's diagnosis before and after applying the MFEA, and (iii) evaluating the diagnosis accuracy of the results. The methodology of the tests encompasses 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the learning of methods and track variation in their performance. The test results show that the MFEA of the multi-agent system finds the best set of features and improves the performance of the classifiers.

  Parkinson's Disease (PD) is frequently associated with cognitive dysfunction ranging from Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) to dementia. Few electrophysiological studies are available evaluating potential pathogenetic mechanisms linked to cognitive impairment in PD since its initial phases. The objective of the study is to analyze electrocortical networks related with cognitive decline in PD-MCI for identifying possible early electrophysiological markers of cognitive impairment in PD.
  Methods
  From the PaCoS (Parkinson's disease Cognitive impairment Study) cohort, a sample of 102 subjects including 46 PD-MCI and 56 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) was selected based on the presence of a neuropsychological assessment and at least one EEG recording. EEG signal epochs were analysed using Independent Component Analysis LORETA and spectral analysis by computing the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of site-specific signal epochs.
  Results
  LORETA analysis revealed significant differences in PD-MCI patients compared to PD-NC, with a decreased network involving alpha activity over the occipital lobe, an increased network involving beta activity over the frontal lobe associated with a reduction over the parietal lobe, an increased network involving theta and delta activity over the frontal lobe and a reduction of networks involving theta and delta activity in the parietal lobe. Quantitative EEG analysis showed a significant decrease of alpha PSD over the occipital regions and an increase of delta PSD over the left temporal region in PD-MCI as compared to PD-NC.
  Conclusion
  Electrocortical abnormalities detected in PD-MCI patients may represent the instrumental counterpart of early cognitive decline in PD.",,,Diagnosis,Cognitive Activity,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

Besides dysfunction of the basal ganglia network, alterations of cortical oscillatory coupling, particularly between prefrontal and (pre-)motoric areas, are thought to underlie this impairment. Here, we studied 16 PD patients OFF and ON medication and age-matched healthy controls recording high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) during performance of spatially coupled and uncoupled bimanual finger movements. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for induced responses was used to infer task-induced effective connectivity within a network comprising bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary motor area (SMA), and primary motor cortex (M1). Performing spatially coupled movements, excitatory left-hemispheric PFC to lPM coupling was significantly stronger in controls compared to unmedicated PD patients. Levodopa-induced enhancement of this connection correlated with increased movement accuracy. During performance of spatially uncoupled movements, PD patients OFF medication exhibited inhibitory connectivity from left PFC to SMA. Levodopa intake diminished these inhibitory influences and restored excitatory PFC to lPM coupling. This restoration, however, did not improve motor function. Concluding, our results indicate that lateralization of prefrontal to premotor connectivity in PD can be augmented by levodopa substitution and is of compensatory nature up to a certain extent of complexity.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

  40% of Parkinson's Disease (PD) sufferers experience insomnia, impacting health and quality of life for patients and family members, especially carers. There is little evidence that current treatments are effective.
  Objectives
  To determine the effectiveness of melatonin in reducing insomnia in 44 individuals with PD using N-of-1 trials. To aggregate group data to arrive at population estimates of effectiveness (measured by improvements in PDSS-2) and safety (measured by adverse events) of melatonin in improving insomnia in PD. To assess the feasibility of offering N-of-1 trials for insomnia in PD.
  Methodology
  Participants will receive either immediate-release melatonin or placebo in random order in 3 paired two-week treatment periods (12 weeks total). Based on their response in a two-week run-in period on 3 mg daily, they will trial either 3 mg or 6 mg. Patients will keep daily sleep diaries and wear a MotionWatch throughout. After the trial patients will discuss their individual report with their doctor, which provides direct feedback about effectiveness and safety of melatonin for them.
  Statistical methods
  We will analyse N-of-1 tests 1) individually: effects of melatonin on PDSS-2 and safety will be reported; and 2) aggregated across individual N-of-1 studies, combined using a Bayesian multilevel random effects model, which will account for repeated measures on individuals over time, and will return posterior estimates of overall treatment effect, and effect in each individual.

Patients with brain lesions involving the motor system are characterized by deficits in action verbs processing in the absence of dementia. We sought to assess whether action verbs interfere with the motor behavior of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) having tremor dominant symptoms. PD tremor is considered to result from dysfunction of cortical-subcortical motor circuits driven by dopamine depletion. In addition, PD tremor is reduced during active movement execution. Therefore, likewise movement execution, the motor simulation of bodily actions predicted by the embodiment may show to be effective in modifying tremor by interfering with a dysfunctional motor system. Here, we asked to simply read and repeat words expressing a hand-related bodily action. Abstract verbs served as control. Changes in tremor kinematics were evaluated using a monoaxial accelerometer. Seventeen PD patients with rest tremor of the upper limbs were enrolled. Tremor amplitude was significantly smaller when reading action verbs as compared to abstract verbs.

A palm-worn device to quantify rigidity in Parkinson's disease,"Perera, Thushara; Lee, Wee-Lih; Jones, Mary; Tan, Joy L.; Proud, Elizabeth L.; Begg, Angus; Sinclair, Nicholas C.; Peppard, Richard; McDermott, Hugh J.",2019,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,"Rigidity, Stiffness, Parkinson's disease, Objective monitoring, Movement disorders","Background
  Parkinsonian rigidity is identified on clinical examination as resistance to passive movement. Measurement of rigidity commonly relies on ordinal rating scales (MDS-UPDRS), however instrumented objective measures may provide greater mechanistic insight.
  New method
  We present a palm-worn instrument to objectively quantify rigidity on a continuous scale. The device employs a miniature motor to flex the third digit of the hand about the metacarpophalangeal joint whilst transducers record flexion/extension forces. We aim to determine congruence with the MDS-UPDRS, investigate sensitivity to the impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and contralateral movement, and make comparisons with healthy individuals. Eight participants with Parkinson's disease underwent evaluation during conditions: on and off DBS, and with and without contralateral limb movement to activate rigidity. During each DBS condition, wash-in/out effects were tracked using both our instrument and two blinded clinical raters. Sixteen healthy volunteers (age-matched/young) served as controls.
  Results
  Rigidity measured using our instrument had moderate agreement with the MDS-UPDRS and showed differences between therapeutic state, activation conditions, and disease/healthy cohorts. Rigidity gradually worsened over a one-hour period after DBS cessation, but improved more rapidly with DBS resumption.
  Comparison with existing methods
  Previous attempts to quantify rigidity include manual approaches where a clinician is required to manipulate limbs while sensors passively gather information, or large automated instruments to move the wrist or elbow.
  Conclusion
  Given its ability to track changes in rigidity due to therapeutic intervention, our technique could have applications where continuous measurement is required or where a suitably qualified rater is absent.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Limb movements,Wearable,,Servo Motor,,,,
Changes in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Related to Freezing of gait in Parkinson's Disease,"Potvin-Desrochers, Alexandra; Mitchell, Trina; Gisiger, Thomas; Paquette, Caroline",2019,Neuroscience,"Freezing of gait, Parkinson's disease, resting-state functional connectivity","Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) thought to arise from the dysfunctional cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuity. The purpose of this study was to assess the changes in brain resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of subcortical structures comprising the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuity in individuals with PD with and without FOG. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 27 individuals with idiopathic PD (14 with FOG and 13 without FOG). A seed-to-voxel analysis was performed with the seeds in the bilateral basal ganglia nuclei, thalamus, and pedunculopontine nucleus. Between-group differences in rs-FC revealed that the bilateral thalamus and globus pallidus external were significantly more connected with visual areas in PD with FOG compared to PD without FOG. In addition, PD with FOG had increased connectivity between the left putamen and retrosplenial cortex as well as with the cerebellum. Our findings suggest an increased connectivity at rest of subcortical and cortical regions involved in sensory and visuospatial processing that may be compensating for sensorimotor deficits in FOG. This increased connectivity may contribute to the hypothesized overload in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuity processing capacity, which may ultimately result in FOG occurrence.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,BioPotential,,MRI,,,,

We demonstrate the potential of voice in serving as a deep phenotype for Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, by presenting methodology for voice signal processing for clinical analysis. Detection of PD symptoms typically requires an exam by a movement disorder specialist and can be hard to access and inconsistent in findings. A vocal digital biomarker could supplement the cumbersome existing manual exam by detecting and quantifying symptoms to guide treatment. Specifically, vocal biomarkers of PD are a potentially effective method of assessing symptoms and severity in daily life, which is the focus of the current research. We analyzed a database of PD patient and non-PD subjects containing voice recordings that were used to extract paralinguistic features, which served as inputs to machine learning models to predict PD severity. The results are presented here and the limitations are discussed given the nature of the recordings. We note that our methodology only advances biomarker research and is not cleared for clinical use. Specifically, we demonstrate that conventional machine learning models applied to voice signals can be used to differentiate participants with PD who exhibit little to no symptoms from healthy controls. This work highlights the potential of voice to be used for early detection of PD and indicates that voice may serve as a deep phenotype for PD, enabling precision medicine by improving the speed, accuracy, accessibility, and cost of PD management.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is utilized as feature extractor and the features are extracted using original vowel signal and the signals of the octopus. In order to feature selection, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is used to remove redundant features. In the classification phase, support vector machine with various activation functions (linear, cubic, radial bases function), 1NN with Manhattan distance, tree and logistic regression are utilized. To obtain individual results, the proposed post processing algorithm is applied to validation predictions. In order to show success of the proposed method, a vowel dataset is used. This dataset contains PD disease vowels and there are gender labels. By using the proposed octopus based method, PD, gender and both PD and gender recognitions are performed. The proposed method achieved 99.21%, 98.41% and 97.62% accuracy rates for gender, PD and gender and PD classification respectively using 1 nearest neighbor (1NN) classifier. The space complexity of the proposed method was calculated and was found as Onlogn. These results clearly indicated that the proposed solves three problems with high success rates and low computational complexity.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,
Estimation and validation of temporal gait features using a markerless 2D video system,"Verlekar, Tanmay T.; Vroey, Henri De; Claeys, Kurt; Hallez, Hans; Soares, LuÃƒÂ­s D.; Correia, Paulo L.",2019,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,"Biomedical analysis, Biomedical gait indicators, Gait analysis, Temporal gait features, Computer vision, Video processing","Background and objective
  Estimation of temporal gait features, such as stance time, swing time and gait cycle time, can be used for clinical evaluations of various patient groups having gait pathologies, such as Parkinson's diseases, neuropathy, hemiplegia and diplegia. Most clinical laboratories employ an optoelectronic motion capture system to acquire such features. However, the operation of these systems requires specially trained operators, a controlled environment and attaching reflective markers to the patient's body. To allow the estimation of the same features in a daily life setting, this paper presents a novel vision based system whose operation does not require the presence of skilled technicians or markers and uses a single 2D camera.
  Method
  The proposed system takes as input a 2D video, computes the silhouettes of the walking person, and then estimates key biomedical gait indicators, such as the initial foot contact with the ground and the toe off instants, from which several other temporal gait features can be derived.
  Results
  The proposed system is tested on two datasets: (i) a public gait dataset made available by CASIA, which contains 20 users, with 4 sequences per user; and (ii) a dataset acquired simultaneously by a marker-based optoelectronic motion capture system and a simple 2D video camera, containing 10 users, with 5 sequences per user. For the CASIA gait dataset A the relevant temporal biomedical gait indicators were manually annotated, and the proposed automated video analysis system achieved an accuracy of 99% on their identification. It was able to obtain accurate estimations even on segmented silhouettes where, the state-of-the-art markerless 2D video based systems fail. For the second database, the temporal features obtained by the proposed system achieved an average intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.86, when compared to the ``gold standard""Â optoelectronic motion capture system.
  Conclusions
  The proposed markerless 2D video based system can be used to evaluate patients' gait without requiring the usage of complex laboratory settings and without the need for physical attachment of sensors/markers to the patients. The good accuracy of the results obtained suggests that the proposed system can be used as an alternative to the optoelectronic motion capture system in non-laboratory environments, which can be enable more regular clinical evaluations.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Video Recording,,Camera,,,,Also Diagnosis

Turning manoeuvres are affected by age, neurological disorders, or frailty. Analyses of the walking turn and its alterations could provide valuable information about functional independence. Most studies involving wearable sensors quantify the turn by descriptive statistical values such as the mean or maximum of the signal. Along with growing interest in walking turn analysis, new parameters should be proposed. From statistics we adapted a parameter, referred to as waveform skewness, that describes the shape of the 180 Ã‚Â° turn signal. This parameter is then compared to established ones and an intraclass-correlation is calculated. The mutual relationship between the proposed parameter and established ones is investigated via correlation. In addition, the effect of different circumstances (temporal alignment, signal scaling and time shift) to the proposed parameter is quantified. Waveform skewness showed a moderate intra-class correlation and a high correlation with the signal peak value. The results showed that waveform skewness is not sensitive to the time shift but is sensitive to signal scaling and temporal alignment. Comparing the waveform skewness between the two subject groups revealed significant differences between Parkinson disease patients and the control group. Quantitative assessment of the 180 Ã‚Â° turn may allow for more objective and sensitive determinations of movement disorders and pathologies.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Wearable,,gyro-accelerometers,100hz,,,
Quantitative mobility metrics from a wearable sensor predict incident parkinsonism in older adults,"von Coelln, Rainer; Dawe, Robert J.; Leurgans, Sue E.; Curran, Thomas A.; Truty, Timothy; Yu, Lei; Barnes, Lisa L.; Shulman, Joshua M.; Shulman, Lisa M.; Bennett, David A.; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.; Buchman, Aron S.",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Parkinsonism, Gait testing, Biosensor, Accelerometry, Longitudinal","Introduction
  Mobility metrics derived from wearable sensor recordings are associated with parkinsonism in older adults. We examined if these metrics predict incident parkinsonism.
  Methods
  Parkinsonism was assessed annually in 683 ambulatory, community-dwelling older adults without parkinsonism at baseline. Four parkinsonian signs were derived from a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Parkinsonism was based on the presence of 2 or more signs. Participants wore a sensor on their back while performing a 32 foot walk, standing posture, and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tasks. 12 mobility scores were extracted. Cox proportional hazards models with backward elimination were used to identify combinations of mobility scores independently associated with incident parkinsonism.
  Results
  During follow-up of 2.5 years (SD = 1.28), 139 individuals developed parkinsonism (20.4%). In separate models, 6 of 12 mobility scores were individually associated with incident parkinsonism, including: Speed and Regularity (from 32 ft walk), Sway (from standing posture), and 3 scores from TUG subtasks (Posterior sit to stand transition, Range stand to sit transition, and Yaw, a measure of turning efficiency). When all mobility scores were analyzed together in a single model, 2 TUG subtask scores, Range from stand to sit transition (HR, 1.42, 95%CI, 1.09, 1.82) and Yaw from turning (HR, 0.56, 95%CI, 0.42, 0.73) were independently associated with incident parkinsonism. These results were unchanged when controlling for chronic health covariates.
  Conclusion
  Mobility metrics derived from a wearable sensor complement conventional gait testing and have potential to enhance risk stratification of older adults who may develop parkinsonism.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,piezoelectric accel- erometers and three gyroscopic sensors,100 hz,,,
Latency of re-emergent tremor in Parkinson's disease is influenced by levodopa,"Wilken, Miguel; Rossi, Malco D.; Rivero, Alberto D.; Hallett, Mark; Merello, Marcelo",2019,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,"Parkinson's disease, Levodopa, Re-emergent tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, Neurophysiology","Introduction
  Re-emergent tremor (RET) is a common form of postural tremor observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Recent studies have shown that administration of levodopa decreases RET amplitude. However, drug effects on tremor pause duration are less clear.
  Methods
  We performed a prospective observational study in PD patients with RET, subjected to acute levodopa challenge. Tremor activity was measured during OFF and ON states both clinically, as well as by using accelerometers taped to the back of both hands. Correlation between RET amplitude and pause duration, as well with MDS-UPDRS scores were investigated. The slope of gradual increase of postural tremor after the pause was also measured in the OFF and ON states.
  Results
  Significant inverse correlation between tremor amplitude and RET pause duration was observed in OFF (rs = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.474, p = 0.030) and ON (rs = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.569, p = 0.006) states. Levodopa reduced tremor amplitude (26%, p = 0.004) dampening slope gradient (22%, p = 0.029). Tremor pause duration also showed inverse correlation with postural tremor amplitude measured by MDS-UPDRS in OFF (rs = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.311, p = 0.048) and ON (rs = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.503, p = 0.020) states, as well as with total MDS-UPDRS Part III score (rs = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.295, p = 0.009). Finally, accelerometric analysis proved to be more sensitive than visual inspection for detecting tremor pauses.
  Conclusion
  Our results suggest RET pause duration is amplitude related, since levodopa-induced amplitude decrease led to pause prolongation, associated with decreased tremor intensity and slope gradient dampening.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Tremor,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,
Investigating the perceived timing of sensory events triggering actions in patients with Parkinson's disease and the effects of dopaminergic therapy,"Yabe, Yoshiko; Goodale, Melvyn A.; MacDonald, Penny A.",2019,Cortex,"Libet's clock, Temporal binding, Parkinson's disease, Dopamine, Aging","Few studies have investigated if Parkinson's disease (PD), advancing age, or exogenous dopamine therapy affect the perceived timing of past events. Here we show a phenomenon of 'temporal repulsion' of a sensory event relative to an action decision in patients with PD. In these patients, the timing of a sensory event triggering an action was perceived to have occurred earlier in time than it really did. In other words, the event appeared to be pushed away in time from the performance of the action. This finding stands in sharp contrast to the 'temporal binding' we have observed here and elsewhere (Yabe etÃ‚Â al., 2017; Yabe & Goodale, 2015) in young healthy participants for whom the perceived onset of a sensory event triggering an action is typically delayed, as if it were pulled towards the action in time. In elderly patients, sensory events were neither repulsed nor pulled toward the action decision event. Exogenous dopamine alleviated the temporal repulsion in PD patients and normalized the temporal binding in healthy elderly controls. In contrast, dopaminergic therapy worsened temporal binding in healthy young participants. We discuss this pattern of findings, relating temporal binding processes to dopaminergic and striatal mechanisms.",10<n<=20,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia,Cueing,,Audio cue,,,,
Automated Parkinson's disease recognition based on statistical pooling method using acoustic features,"Yaman, Orhan; Ertam, Fatih; Tuncer, Turker",2019,Medical Hypotheses,"Parkinson's Disease Recognition, Acoustic Features, Statistical Pooling, KNN, SVM","Parkinson's disease is one of the mostly seen neurological disease. It affects to nervous system and hinders people's vital activities. The majority of Parkinson's patients lose their ability to speak, write and balance. Many machine learning methods have been proposed to automatically diagnose Parkinson's disease using acoustic, hand writing and gaits. In this study, a statistical pooling method is proposed to recognize Parkinson's disease using the vowels. The used Parkinson's disease dataset contains the features of vowels. In the proposed method, the features of dataset are increased by applying statistical pooling method. Then, the most weighted features are selected from increased feature vector by using ReliefF. The classification is applied using the most weighted feature vector obtained. In the proposed method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms are used. The success rate was calculated as 91.25% and 91.23% with by using SVM and KNN respectively.

Both methods were developed in MATLAB platform by managing and analyzing motion data in graphical user interface (GUI) form. By attaching the wearable sensors to each segments of interest, the collected data can be reconstructed in real time basis. Artificial intelligence technique is proposed to classify the subjects' motions. Data reconstruction technique can be used to regenerate the motion of subjects' limbs movement in 2D representation. Corresponding tests are performed to validate the accuracy of the application. The application is potentially to be used to access the quality of human motion in hospitals, clinics and human motion research. An experiment was set up in a laboratory environment for data collecting. Subjects were asked to perform three shape drawings using left and right hands. The instruments demonstrate adequate internal consistency of optimum average accuracy of 52 % for decision tree and 80 % for principle component analysis. Results were presented in tabular, image and graphical forms.

Different methods have been developed based on visual or electrical signals. However, such signals are acquired by external devices and are not intrinsic signals that are created on the body. Here, we report a new universal body motion sensor (UBS) to detect motions based on the intrinsic contact electrification (CE) of the skin or electrical induction (EI) of the body. The CE or EI generates charges on the body, leading to potential differences between the body and ground that can be measured to identify different body motions, such as motions of the head, arms, fingers, waist, legs, feet and toes. Proof-of-concept experiments have demonstrated that the UBS can be used to monitor the conditions of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to quantitatively monitor the recovery of those with a leg injury, suggesting great potential for healthcare applications.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Force/Pressure,,novel UBS sensor,,,,
Altered EEG alpha and theta oscillations characterize apathy in Parkinson's disease during incentivized movement,"Zhu, Maria; HajiHosseini, Azadeh; Baumeister, Tobias R.; Garg, Saurabh; Appel-Cresswell, Silke; McKeown, Martin J.",2019,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Apathy, Parkinson's disease, Motivation, EEG, Oscillations, Alpha, Theta","Apathy is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is difficult to quantify and poorly understood. Some studies have used incentivized motor tasks to assess apathy, as the condition is often associated with a reduction in motivated behavior. Normally event-related desynchronization, a reduction of power in specific frequency bands, is observed in the motor cortex during the peri-movement period. Also, alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) oscillations are sensitive to rewards that are closely related to motivational states however these oscillations have not been widely investigated in relation to apathy in PD. Using EEG recordings, we investigated the neural oscillatory characteristics of apathy in PD during an incentivized motor task with interleaved rest periods. Apathetic and non-apathetic PD subjects on dopaminergic medication and healthy control subjects were instructed to squeeze a hand grip device for a monetary reward proportional to the subject's grip force and the monetary value attributed to that trial. Apathetic PD subjects exhibited higher alpha and theta powers in the pre-trial baseline rest period compared to non-apathetic PD subjects and healthy subjects. Further, we found that both resting power and relative power in alpha and theta bands during incentivized movement predicted PD subjects' apathy scores. Our results suggest that apathetic PD patients may need to overcome greater baseline alpha and theta oscillatory activity in order to facilitate incentivized movement. Clinically, resting alpha and theta power as well as alpha and theta event-related desynchronization during movement may serve as potential neural markers for apathy severity in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,
A low-cost vision system based on the analysis of motor features for recognition and severity rating of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease,"Buongiorno, Domenico; Bortone, Ilaria; Cascarano, Giacomo Donato; Trotta, Gianpaolo Francesco; Brunetti, Antonio; Bevilacqua, Vitoantonio",2019,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,"Classification,Artificial neural network,Support vector machine,Feature selection,Parkinsonâ€™s disease,Gait analysis,Finger tapping,Foot tapping,MDS-UPDRS,Microsoft kinect v2","Assessment and rating of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) are commonly based on the medical observation of several clinical manifestations, including the analysis of motor activities. In particular, medical specialists refer to the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society â€“ sponsored revision of Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale) that is the most widely used clinical scale for PD rating. However, clinical scales rely on the observation of some subtle motor phenomena that are either difficult to capture with human eyes or could be misclassified. This limitation motivated several researchers to develop intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms able to automatically recognize the PD. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies investigated the classification between healthy subjects and PD patients without considering the automatic rating of different levels of severity. In this context, we implemented a simple and low-cost clinical tool that can extract postural and kinematic features with the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor in order to classify and rate PD. Thirty participants were enrolled for the purpose of the present study: sixteen PD patients rated according to MDS-UPDRS and fourteen healthy paired subjects. In order to investigate the motor abilities of the upper and lower body, we acquired and analyzed three main motor tasks: (1) gait, (2) finger tapping, and (3) foot tapping. After preliminary feature selection, different classifiers based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were trained and evaluated for the best solution. Concerning the gait analysis, results showed that the ANN classifier performed the best by reaching 89.4% of accuracy with only nine features in diagnosis PD and 95.0% of accuracy with only six features in rating PD severity. Regarding the finger and foot tapping analysis, results showed that an SVM using the extracted features was able to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients with great performances by reaching 87.1% of accuracy. The results of the classification between mild and moderate PD patients indicated that the foot tapping features were the most representative ones to discriminate (81.0% of accuracy). The results of this study have shown how a low-cost vision-based system can automatically detect subtle phenomena featuring the PD. Our findings suggest that the proposed tool can support medical specialists in the assessment and rating of PD patients in a real clinical scenario.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Motion Tracker,,Kinect,,,,Also Prognosis/Monitoring of Disease

The computer-aided analysis of the handwriting allows for the identification of promising patterns that might be useful in PD detection and rating. In this study, we propose an innovative set of features extracted by geometrical, dynamical and muscle activation signals acquired during handwriting tasks, and evaluate the contribution of such features in detecting and rating PD by means of artificial neural networks. Eleven healthy subjects and twenty-one PD patients were enrolled in this study. Each involved subject was asked to write three different patterns on a graphic tablet while wearing the Myo Armband used to collect the muscle activation signals of the main forearm muscles. We have then extracted several features related to the written pattern, the movement of the pen and the pressure exerted with the pen and the muscle activations. The computed features have been used to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients and to discriminate mild PD patients from moderate PD patients by using an artificial neural network (ANN). After the training and evaluation of different ANN topologies, the obtained results showed that the proposed features have high relevance in PD detection and rating. In particular, we found that our approach both detect and rate (mild and moderate PD) with a classification accuracy higher than 90%. In this paper we have investigated the representativeness of a set of proposed features related to handwriting tasks in PD detection and rating. In particular, we used an ANN to classify healthy subjects and PD patients (PD detection), and to classify mild and moderate PD patients (PD rating).

Consequently, 24-h home monitoring in a real-world environment would be an ideal solution for precise symptom diagnostics. In recent years, small lightweight sensors which have assisted in objective, reliable analysis of motor symptoms have attracted a lot of attention. While technical advances are important, patient acceptance of such new systems is just as crucial to increase long-term adherence. So far, there has been a lack of long-term evaluations of PD-patient sensor adherence and acceptance. In a pilot study of PD patients (N = 4), adherence (wearing time) and acceptance (questionnaires) of a multi-part sensor set was evaluated over a 4-week timespan. The evaluated sensor set consisted of 3 body-worn sensors and 7 at-home installed ambient sensors. After one month of continuous monitoring, the overall system usability scale (SUS)-questionnaire score was 71.5%, with an average acceptance score of 87% for the body-worn sensors and 100% for the ambient sensors. On average, sensors were worn 15 h and 4 min per day. All patients reported strong preferences of the sensor set over manual self-reporting methods.

Candidate features were extracted from the PKG data and matched to the class labels. Several linear and non-linear candidate statistical models were examined and compared to classify the six categories of severity. The resulting model predicted a clinically significant LR with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.92.

The kinematics of the hand was traced with Leap motion controller, motivation effect was assessed with modified Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and clinical effectiveness was evaluated with Box & Blocks Test (BBT) and shortened Unified Parkinsonâ€™s disease rating scale (UPDRS) before and after the training. Mack-Skilling non-parametrical statistical test was used to identify statistically significant differences ( p Â <â€‰0.05) and Cohenâ€™s U3 test to find the effect sizes. Participants in the 3D group demonstrated statistically significant and substantially better performance in average time of manipulation (group x time, p Â =â€‰0.009), number of successfully placed cubes (group x time, p Â =â€‰0.028), average tremor (group x time, p Â =â€‰0.002) and UPDRS for upper limb (U3â€‰=â€‰0.35). The LCD and 3D groups substantially improved their BBT score with training (U3â€‰=â€‰0.7, U3â€‰=â€‰0.6, respectively). However, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical tests between the groups (group x time, p Â =â€‰0.2189, p Â =â€‰0.2850, respectively). In addition the LCD group significantly decreased the pressure/tension (U3â€‰=â€‰0.3), the 3D did not show changes (U3â€‰=â€‰0.5) and the differences between the groups were statistically different ( p Â =â€‰0.037). The 3D group demonstrated important increase in effort (U3â€‰=â€‰0.75) and perceived competences (U3â€‰=â€‰0.9). The outcomes of the study demonstrated that the immersive 3D technology may bring increased interests/enjoyment score resulting in faster and more efficient functional performance. But the 2D technology demonstrated lower pressure/tension score providing similar clinical progress. A study with much larger sample size may also confirm the clinical effectiveness of the approaches.

Non-motor correlates of wrist-worn wearable sensor use in Parkinsonâ€™s disease: an exploratory analysis,"van Wamelen, Daniel J.; Hota, Shweta; Podlewska, Aleksandra; Leta, Valentina; Trivedi, Dhaval; Rizos, Alexandra; Parry, Miriam; Chaudhuri, K. Ray",2019,NPJ Parkinson's Disease,"Outcomes research,Parkinson's disease","Wearable sensors are becoming increasingly more available in Parkinsonâ€™s disease and are used to measure motor function. Whether non-motor symptoms (NMS) can also be measured with these wearable sensors remains unclear. We therefore performed a retrospective, exploratory, analysis of 108 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinsonâ€™s disease enroled in the Non-motor Longitudinal International Study (UKCRN No. 10084) at Kingâ€™s College Hospital, London, to determine the association between the range and nature of NMS and an accelerometer-based outcome measure of bradykinesia (BKS) and dyskinesia (DKS). NMS were assessed by the validated NMS Scale, and included, e.g., cognition, mood and sleep, and gastrointestinal, urinary and sexual problems. Multiple linear regression modelling was used to identify NMS associated with BKS and DKS. We found that BKS was associated with domains 6 (gastrointestinal tract; p â€‰=â€‰0.006) and 8 (sexual function; p â€‰=â€‰0.003) of the NMS scale. DKS was associated with domains 3 (mood/cognition; p â€‰=â€‰0.016), 4 (perceptual problems; p â€‰=â€‰0.025), 6 (gastrointestinal tract; p â€‰=â€‰0.029) and 9 (miscellaneous, p â€‰=â€‰0.003). In the separate domains, constipation was significantly associated with BKS. Delusions, dysphagia, hyposmia, weight change and hyperhidrosis were identified as significantly associated with DKS. None of the NMSS domains were associated with disease duration ( p â€‰â‰¥â€‰0.08). In conclusion, measures of BKS and DKS were mainly associated with gastrointestinal problems, independent of disease duration, showing the potential for wearable devices to pick up on these symptoms. These exploratory results deserve further exploration, and more research on this topic in the form of comprehensive large-scale studies is needed.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

It's hallmark signs and symptoms include slow movements, rigidity, tremor, and unstable posture. Additionally, non-motor symptoms such as sleeplessness, depression, cognitive impairment, impulse control behaviors (ICB) have been reported. Today, treatment regimens to modify disease progression do not exist and as such, treatment is focused on symptom relief. Additionally, physicians are challenged to base their diagnoses and treatment plans on unreliable self-reported symptoms, even when used in conjunction to validated assessments such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and clinical exams. Wearable technology may provide clinicians objective measures of motor problems to supplement current subjective methods. Global Kinetics Corporation (GKC) has developed a watch-device called the Personal KinetiGraph (PKG) that records movements and provides patients medication dosing reminders. A separate clinician-use report supplies longitudinal motor and event data. The PKG was FDA-cleared in September 2016. We studied 63 PD patients during 85 routine care visits in 2 US academic institutions, evaluating the clinical utility of the PKG. Patients wore a PKG for 6 continuous days before their visit. Next, PKG data was uploaded to produce a report. In clinic, physicians discussed PD symptoms with patients and conducted a motor examination prior to reviewing the PKG report and comparing it to their initial assessments. Lastly, patient, caregiver and physician satisfaction surveys were conducted by each user. Across all visits when patients did not report bradykinesia or dyskinesia, the PKG reported these symptoms (50 and 33% of the time, respectively). The PKG provided insights for treatment plans in 50 (79%) patients across 71 (84%) visits. Physicians found improved patient dialogue in 50 (59%) visits, improved ability to assess treatment impact in 32 (38%) visits, and improved motor assessment in 28 (33%) visits. Patients stated in 82% of responses that they agreed or strongly agreed in PKG training, usability, performance, and satisfaction. In 39% of responses, they also reported a very valuable impact on their care. PKG use in 63 PD patients within our clinical practice showed clinically relevant utility in many areas.",,,Rehabilitation,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,PKG,,,,

Tremor is measured as part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III. However, the assessment is based on onsite physical examinations and does not fully represent the patientsâ€™ tremor experience in their day-to-day life. Our objective in this paper was to develop algorithms that, combined with wearable sensors, can estimate total Parkinsonian tremor as the patients performed a variety of free body movements. We developed two methods: an ensemble model based on gradient tree boosting and a deep learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The developed methods were assessed on gyroscope sensor data from 24 PD subjects. Our analysis demonstrated that the method based on gradient tree boosting provided a high correlation ( r = 0.96 using held-out testing and r = 0.93 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation) between the estimated and clinically assessed tremor subscores in comparison to the LSTM-based method with a moderate correlation ( r = 0.84 using held-out testing and r = 0.77 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation).

The objective of the Clinician Input Study was to assess the feasibility and clinical utility of data obtained using a mobile health technology from PD patients. In this observational, exploratory study, PD participants wore a smartwatch and used the Fox Wearable Companion mobile phone app to stream movement data and report symptom severity and medication intake for 6 months. Data were analyzed using the IntelÂ® Pharma Analytics Platform. Clinicians reviewed participantsâ€™ data in a dashboard during in-office visits at 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months. Clinicians provided feedback in focus groups leading to dashboard updates. Between June and August 2017, 51 PD patients were recruited at four US sites, and 39 (76%) completed the 6-month study. Patients streamed 83,432â€‰h of movement data from their smartwatches (91% of expected). Reporting of symptoms and medication intake using the app was lower than expected, 44% and 60%, respectively, but did not differ according to baseline characteristics. Cliniciansâ€™ feedback resulted in ten updates to the dashboard during the study period. Clinicians reported that medications and patient reported outcomes were generally discernable in the dashboard and complementary to clinical assessments. Movement, symptoms, and medication intake data were feasibly translated from the app into a clinician dashboard but there was substantial attrition rate over 6 months. Further enhancements are needed to ensure long-term patient adherence to portable technologies and optimal digital data transfer to clinicians caring for PD patients.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,Wearable,,SmartWatch IMU,,,,
Dopaminergic Modulation of Sensory Attenuation in Parkinson's Disease: Is There an Underlying Modulation of Beta Power?,"Macerollo, Antonella; Limousin, Patricia; Korlipara, Prasad; Foltynie, Tom; Edwards, Mark J.; Kilner, James",2019,Frontiers in Neurology,"Parkinson's disease,sensory attenuation,beta power,bradykinesia,motor symptoms","Background and Aims: Pathological high amplitude of beta oscillations is thought as the underlying mechanism of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), in particular with regard to bradykinesia. In addition, abnormality in a neurophysiological phenomenon labeled sensory attenuation has been found in patients with PD. The current study explored the hypothesis that the abnormal sensory attenuation has a causal link with the typical abnormality in beta oscillations in PD. Methods: The study tested sixteen right-handed patients with a diagnosis of PD and 22 healthy participants, which were matched by age and gender. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited through electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Electrical activity was recorded at the scalp using a 128 channels EEG. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in 2 conditions: at rest and at the onset of a voluntary movement, which was a self-paced abduction movement of the right thumb. Results: Healthy participants showed a reduction of the N20-P25 amplitude at the onset of the right thumb abduction compared to the rest condition ( P < 0.05). When patients were OFF medication, they showed mild reduction of the N20-P25 component at movement onset ( P < 0.05). On the contrary, they did show greater attenuation of the N20-P25 component at the onset of movement compared to the rest condition when ON medication ( P < 0.05). There was no significant evidence of a link between the degree of sensory attenuation and the change in beta oscillations in our cohort of patients. Conclusion: These results confirmed a significant link between dopaminergic modulation and sensory attenuation. However, the sensory attenuation and beta oscillations were found as two independent phenomena.",10<n<=20,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Limb movements,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

The goal of this study was to analyze the magnitude of correlation between the numeric output of the device algorithm and the results of the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS), administered by a physician. In this study, 13 Parkinsonâ€™s patients, who were symptomatic with dyskinesias, were monitored with the device at home, for an average period of 30â€‰minutes, while performing normal daily life activities. Each patientâ€™s activity was simultaneously video-recorded. A physician was in charge of reviewing the recorded videos and determining the severity of dyskinesia through the UDysRS for every patient. The sensor device yielded only one value for dyskinesia severity, which was calculated by averaging the recorded device readings. Correlation between the results of physicianâ€™s assessment and the sensor output was analyzed with the Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient between the sensor output and UDysRS result was 0.70 (CI 95%: 0.33â€“0.88; pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Since the sensor was located on the waist, the correlation between the sensor output and the results of the trunk and legs scale sub-items was calculated: 0.91 (CI 95% 0.76â€“0.97: pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).

Movement smoothness measurements, such as the spectral arc length (SPARC), are novel approaches to quantify movement quality. Previous studies analyzed SPARC in simple walking conditions. However, SPARC outcomes during functional mobility tasks in subjects with PD and Freezing of gait (FOG) were never investigated. This study aimed to analyze SPARC during the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test in individuals with PD and FOG. Thirty-one participants with PD and FOG and six healthy controls were included. SPARC during TUG test was calculated for linear and angular accelerations using an inertial measurement unit system. SPARC data were correlated with clinical parameters: motor section of the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn & Yahr scale, Freezing of gait Questionnaire, and TUG test. We reported lower SPARC values (reduced smoothness) during the entire TUG test, turn and stand to sit in subjects with PD and FOG, compared to healthy controls. Unlike healthy controls, individuals with PD and FOG displayed a broad spectral range that encompassed several dominant frequencies. SPARC metrics also correlated with all the above-mentioned clinical parameters. SPARC values provide valid and relevant clinical data about movement quality (e.g., smoothness) of subjects with PD and FOG during a functional mobility test.

Although spatiotemporal characteristics of FOG are well-described, their underlying neuromuscular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Several studies have demonstrated an abnormal activation of distal muscles of the lower limb and coordination impairments during gait in people with PD (pwPD). However, few have investigated how various characteristics of electromyograms (EMGs) change before, during and after a freezing episode (FE). Our objective was to quantify changes in proximal and distal leg muscle activity associated with FEs. In this study, 12 pwPD, confirmed as freezers, performed a repetitive stepping-in-place task used to elicit FE. Surface EMGs were collected from proximal [rectus femoris and biceps femoris (BF)] and distal [tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM)] muscles. Data epochs of 500 ms were extracted from EMG time series at four different periods: baseline, 2 s before a FE, during a FE, and 2 s after a FE. For each epoch, EMG amplitude [root-mean-square (RMS)], variability [coefficient of variation (CoV)], and inter-muscle functional connectivity (mutual information) were quantified. Results from the analysis of 21 FEs show a significant main effect of Period for EMG amplitude in bilateral TA and in the least affected GM ( p < 0.01), with decreased activation before freezing that remained low during and after the FE. On the other hand, a main effect of Period was also found in bilateral BF muscles ( p < 0.01) but with increased activation before freezing that was generally sustained during and after FE. Main effects of Period were also found for all measures of variability, except for the least affected GM, showing reduced variability during the FE that returned to baseline in all muscles except both TA. Moreover, an increase in functional connectivity between the least affected distal muscles was seen before the FE. Our findings confirm that many characteristics of EMG patterns of both distal and proximal leg muscles change throughout periods of a FE, suggesting both impairment and adaptive strategies from proximal muscles.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,BioPotential,,EMG,,,,

In this paper, we describe deep learning models for diagnosis/prognosis derived from a few minutes of eyes-closed resting electroencephalography data (EEG) collected at baseline from idiopathic RBD patients ( n = 121) and healthy controls (HC, n = 91). A few years after the EEG acquisition (4Â±2 years), a subset of the RBD patients were eventually diagnosed with either PD ( n = 14) or Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), while the rest remained idiopathic RBD. We describe first a simple deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with a five-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG spectrograms from idiopathic patients and healthy controls. We treat the data as in audio or image classification problems where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. For comparison, we study a simple deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model using three stacked Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) cells or gated-recurrent unit (GRU) cellsâ€”with very similar results. The performance of these networks typically reaches 80% (Â±1%) classification accuracy in the balanced HC vs. PD-conversion classification problem. In particular, using data from the best single EEG channel, we obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 87% (Â±1%)â€”while avoiding spectral feature selection. The trained classifier can also be used to generate synthetic spectrograms using the DeepDream algorithm to study what time-frequency features are relevant for classification. We find these to be bursts in the theta band together with a decrease of bursting in the alpha band in future RBD converters (i.e., converting to PD or DLB in the follow up) relative to HCs. From this first study, we conclude that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, offering physiological insights and enabling the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers.",,,Diagnosis,Sleep Topics,BioPotential,,EEG,,,,

Current gait assessments mostly focus on straight strides with assumed constant velocity, while acceleration/deceleration and turning strides are often ignored. This is either due to the set up of typical clinical assessments or technical limitations in capture volume. Wearable inertial measurement units are a promising and unobtrusive technology to overcome these limitations. Other gait phases such as initiation, termination, transitioning (between straight walking and turning) and turning might be relevant as well for the evaluation of gait and balance impairments in PD. In a cohort of 119 PD patients, we applied unsupervised algorithms to find different gait clusters which potentially include the clinically relevant information from distinct gait phases in the standardized 4x10 m gait test. To clinically validate our approach, we determined the discriminative power in each gait cluster to classify between impaired and unimpaired PD patients and compared it to baseline (analyzing all straight strides). As a main result, analyzing only one of the gait clusters constant, non-constant or turning led in each case to a better classification performance in comparison to the baseline (increase of area under the curve (AUC) up to 19% relative to baseline). Furthermore, gait parameters (for turning, constant and non-constant gait) that best predict motor impairment in PD were identified. We conclude that a more detailed analysis in terms of different gait clusters of standardized gait tests such as the 4x10 m walk may give more insights about the clinically relevant motor impairment in PD patients.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

We enrolled 50 patients with PD who were randomly assigned to two different modalities of treadmill gait training using GaitTrainer3 with and without RAS (non_RAS) during an 8-week training program. We measured clinical, kinematic, and electrophysiological effects of both the gait trainings. We found a greater improvement in Functional Gait Assessment ( p â€‰<â€‰0.001), Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale ( p â€‰<â€‰0.001), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale ( p â€‰=â€‰0.001), and overall gait quality index ( p â€‰<â€‰0.001) following RAS than non_RAS training. In addition, the RAS gait training induced a stronger EEG power increase within the sensorimotor rhythms related to specific periods of the gait cycle, and a greater improvement of fronto-centroparietal/temporal electrode connectivity than the non_RAS gait training. The findings of our study suggest that the usefulness of cueing strategies during gait training consists of a reshape of sensorimotor rhythms and fronto-centroparietal/temporal connectivity. Restoring the internal timing mechanisms that generate and control motor rhythmicity, thus improving gait performance, likely depends on a contribution of the cerebellum.

Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of walking function recovery is to walk on the ground rather than on the treadmill. This study aims to determine the effect of treadmill walking on gait and upper trunk movement characteristics using wearable sensors. Eight healthy male subjects are recruited to perform 420-m straight overground walking (OW) and 5 min treadmill walking (TW), wearing 3 inertial measurement units and a pair of insole sensors. In addition to common linear features, nonlinear features, which contains sample entropy, maximal Lyapunov exponent and fractal dynamic of stride intervals (detrended fluctuation analysis), are used to compare the difference between TW and OW condition. Canonical correlation analysis is also used to indicate the correlation between upper trunk movement characteristics and gait features in the aspects of spatiotemporal parameters and gait dynamic features. The experimental results show that the treadmill can cause a shorter stride length, less stride time and worsen long-range correlation of stride intervals. And the treadmill can significantly increase the stability for both gait and upper trunk, while it can significantly reduce gait regularity during swing phase. Canonical correlation analysis results show that treadmill can reduce the correlation between gait and upper trunk features. One possible interpretation of these results is that people tend to walk more cautiously to prevent the risk of falling and neglect the coordination between gait and upper trunk when walking on the treadmill. This study can provide fundamental insightful information about the effect of treadmill walking on gait and upper trunk to support future similar studies.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Gait,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

It results from degeneration of Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc) of the Basal Ganglia (BG). Gait disturbances in PD patients generally get worse over time. The underlying mechanism of gait disturbances in PD has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we tried to analyze changes in walking performance under both single- and dual-task conditions in people with PD compared to healthy subjects. To this end, the participantsâ€™ trunk acceleration signals were recorded under dual-task (counting the stride number while walking) and single-task (walking without performing any other secondary tasks) conditions. The healthy subjects counted the number of their strides correctly; however, 85% of the patients made glaring errors in counting. Then variances of Stride Time Interval (STI) signals were calculated for each participant. STI signals of the patients had a higher variance than that of the healthy subjects in the dual-task condition. Separating the two groups in a dual-task condition is easier. Therefore, we think that the disease sate can be detected in early stages. It is thought that counting is performed independent of walking. PD affects the function of BG that leads to motor timing dysfunction. So, it seems that timing in motor tasks is disrupted while timing in cognitive tasks is not. Therefore, perhaps inconsistency between the two clocks (motor-tasks and cognitive-tasks clocks) is the main cause of dual-task interference in patientsâ€™ gait.",>30,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,Research Article,

Materials and Methods: A comprehensive retrospective review of charts was performed to include patients with parkinsonian disorders who had at least one EEG recording available. A modified grand total EEG (GTE) score evaluating the posterior background activity, and diffuse and focal slow wave activities was used in further analyses. Results: We analyzed data from 76 patients with a final diagnosis of either IPD, probable corticobasal degeneration (CBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), or progressive supra-nuclear palsy (PSP). IPD patients had the lowest mean GTE score, followed those with CBD or MSA, while PSP patients scored the highest. However, none of these differences were statistically significant. A GTE score of â‰¤9 distinguished IPD patients from those with APD (p < 0.01) with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 33.3%.

This study aims to validate an ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) device for the detection of sleep and wake states and apply it to the evaluation of sleep quality in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). A polysomnographic validation study was conducted on a group of patients with different sleep disorders in a preliminary phase, followed by a pilot study to apply this methodology to PD patients. The ACM device makes it possible to estimate the main sleep parameters very accurately, as demonstrated by: (a) the lack of significant differences between the mean values detected by PSG and ACM in time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and time awake after sleep onset (WASO); (b) the slope of the correlation lines between the parameters estimated by the two procedures, very close to 1, which demonstrates the linearity of the predictions; (c) the low bias value in the estimates obtained through ACM. Sleep in PD is associated with lower distal skin temperature, efficiency and overall sleep time; greater WASO, activity during sleep and duration of naps and a worse circadian function index. In summary, the ACM device has proven to be clinically useful to evaluate sleep in an objective manner, thanks to the integrated management of different complementary variables, having advantages over conventional actigraphy.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Sleep Topics,Wearable,,"Accelerometer, Temp Sensor, Light Sensors",,,,
Identification of Motor Symptoms Related to Parkinson Disease Using Motion-Tracking Sensors at Home (KÃ„VELI): Protocol for an Observational Case-Control Study,,2019,JMIR Research Protocols,"Parkinson disease,movement analysis,gait,wearable sensors,smartphone,home monitoring,mobile phone","Clinical characterization of motion in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) is challenging: symptom progression, suitability of medication, and level of independence in the home environment can vary across time and patients. Appointments at the neurological outpatient clinic provide a limited understanding of the overall situation. In order to follow up these variations, longer-term measurements performed outside of the clinic setting could help optimize and personalize therapies. Several wearable sensors have been used to estimate the severity of symptoms in PD; however, longitudinal recordings, even for a short duration of a few days, are rare. Home recordings have the potential benefit of providing a more thorough and objective follow-up of the disease while providing more information about the possible need to change medications or consider invasive treatments. The primary objective of this study is to collect a dataset for developing methods to detect PD-related symptoms that are visible in walking patterns at home. The movement data are collected continuously and remotely at home during the normal lives of patients with PD as well as controls. The secondary objective is to use the dataset to study whether the registered medication intakes can be identified from the collected movement data by looking for and analyzing short-term changes in walking patterns. This paper described the protocol for an observational case-control study that measures activity using three different devices: (1) a smartphone with a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and phone orientation sensor, (2) a Movesense smart sensor to measure movement data from the wrist, and (3) a Forciot smart insole to measure the forces applied on the feet. The measurements are first collected during the appointment at the clinic conducted by a trained clinical physiotherapist. Subsequently, the subjects wear the smartphone at home for 3 consecutive days. Wrist and insole sensors are not used in the home recordings. Data collection began in March 2018. Subject recruitment and data collection will continue in spring 2019. The intended sample size was 150 subjects. In 2018, we collected a sample of 103 subjects, 66 of whom were diagnosed with PD. This study aims to produce an extensive movement-sensor dataset recorded from patients with PD in various phases of the disease as well as from a group of control subjects for effective and impactful comparison studies. The study also aims to develop data analysis methods to monitor PD symptoms and the effects of medication intake during normal life and outside of the clinic setting. Further applications of these methods may include using them as tools for health care professionals to monitor PD remotely and applying them to other movement disorders.

"Remnants of Cardinal Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, Not Dyskinesia, Are Problematic for Dyskinetic Patients Performing Activities of Daily Living","Goubault, Etienne; Nguyen, Hung P.; Bogard, Sarah; Blanchet, Pierre J.; BÃ©zard, Erwan; Vincent, Claude; Sarna, Justyna; Monchi, Oury; Duval, Christian",2019,Frontiers in Neurology,"Parkinson disease,levodopa-induced dyskinesia,activities of daily living,motor performance,cardinal symptoms","Introduction: The impact of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) on the daily lives of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be determined. Furthermore, evidence suggests that cardinal motor symptoms of PD may coexist with LID, but their impact on activities of daily living (ADL) relative to LID is not known. This cross-sectional study aimed at determining the effect of LID and cardinal motor symptoms of PD on ADL in patients who were experiencing peak-dose choreic-type LID. Method: One hundred and twenty-one patients diagnosed with PD known to experience choreic-type LID were recruited for the study. Patients were asked to perform a set of ADL. Levels of LID, tremor, bradykinesia, and Freezing of gait (FoG) were measured using 17 inertial sensors design to capture full body movements, while rigidity, and postural instability were assessed using clinical evaluations. Cognition was also assessed using the mini-mental state examination. Success criteria were set for each ADL using the time needed to perform the task and errors measured in 69 age-gender-matched healthy controls. Binary logistic regressions were used to identify symptoms influencing success or failure for each activity. Receiver operating characteristic curves were computed on each significant symptom, and Youden indexes were calculated to determine the critical level of symptomatology at which the performance significantly changed. Results: Results show that 97.7% of patients who presented with LID during the experiment also presented with at least one cardinal motor symptom. On average, patients took more time and did more errors during ADL. Multivariate analyses revealed that for the great majority of ADL, LID were not associated with worsening of performance; however, postural instability, tremor, rigidity, and cognitive decline significantly decreased the odds of success. Conclusions: Residual symptoms of PD, such as tremor, rigidity, and postural instability still present at peak-dose were more problematic than LID in the performance of ADL for patients experiencing slight-to-moderate LID. We also found that cognitive decline was associated with decreased performance in certain tasks. Therefore, a strategy using lower doses of medication to manage LID may be counterproductive since it would not address most of these symptoms already present in patients.",>30,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,IMU,,,,
The Diagnostic Scope of Sensor-Based Gait Analysis in Atypical Parkinsonism: Further Observations,"GaÃŸner, Heiko; Raccagni, Cecilia; Eskofier, Bjoern M.; Klucken, Jochen; Wenning, Gregor K.",2019,Frontiers in Neurology,"neurologic gait disorders,postural balance,biosensors,Parkinson disease,progressive supranuclear palsy,multisystem atrophy,gait analysis","Background: Differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) from atypical Parkinsonian disorders (APD) is challenging, especially in early disease stages. Postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) are substantial motor impairments of IPD and APD. Clinical evidence implies that patients with APD have larger PIGD impairment than IPD patients. Sensor-based gait analysis as instrumented bedside test revealed more gait deficits in APD compared to IPD. However, the diagnostic value of instrumented bedside tests compared to clinical assessments in differentiating APD from IPD patients have not been evaluated so far. Objective: The objectives were (a) to evaluate whether sensor-based gait parameters provide additional information to validated clinical scores in differentiating APD from matched IPD patients, and (b) to investigate if objective, instrumented gait assessments have comparable discriminative power to clinical scores. Methods: In a previous study we have recorded instrumented gait parameters in patients with APD (Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy). Here, we compared gait parameters to those of retrospectively pairwise disease duration-, age-, and gender-matched IPD patients in order to address this new research questions. To this aim, the PIGD score was calculated as sum of the MDS-UPDRS-3-items â€œgait,â€ â€œpostural stability,â€ â€œarising from chair,â€ and â€œposture.â€ Gait characteristics were evaluated in standardized gait tests using an instrumented, sensor-based gait analysis system. Machine learning algorithms were used to extract spatio-temporal gait parameters. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was performed in order to detect the discriminative power of the instrumented vs. the clinical bedside tests in differentiating IPD from APD. Results: Sensor-based stride length, gait velocity, toe off angle, and parameters representing gait variability significantly differed between IPD and APD groups. ROC analysis revealed a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) for PIGD score (0.919), and UPDRS-3 (0.848). Particularly, the objective parameters stance time variability (0.841), swing time variability (0.834), stride time variability (0.821), and stride length variability (0.804) reached high AUC's as well. Conclusions: PIGD symptoms showed high discriminative power in differentiating IPD from APD supporting gait disorders as substantial diagnostic target. Sensor-based gait variability parameters provide metric, objective added value, and serve as complementary outcomes supporting clinical diagnostics and long-term home-monitoring concepts.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait, Posture, Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia",Wearable,IMU,,,,,
Less Is More â€“ Estimation of the Number of Strides Required to Assess Gait Variability in Spatially Confined Settings,"Kroneberg, Daniel; Elshehabi, Morad; Meyer, Anne-Christiane; Otte, Karen; Doss, Sarah; Paul, Friedemann; Nussbaum, Susanne; Berg, Daniela; KÃ¼hn, Andrea A.; Maetzler, Walter; Schmitz-HÃ¼bsch, Tanja",2019,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,"gait variability,gait analysis,turn detection,healthy elderly,movement disorders","Background: Gait variability is an established marker of gait function that can be assessed using sensor-based approaches. In clinical settings, spatial constraints and patient condition impede the execution of longer distance walks for the recording of gait parameters. Turning paradigms are often used to overcome these constraints and commercial gait analysis systems algorithmically exclude turns for gait parameters calculations. We investigated the effect of turns in sensor-based assessment of gait variability. Methods: Continuous recordings from 31 patients with movement disorders (ataxia, essential tremor and Parkinsonâ€™s disease) and 162 healthy elderly (HE) performing level walks including 180Â° turns were obtained using an inertial sensor system. Accuracy of the manufacturerâ€™s algorithm of turn-detection was verified by plotting stride time series. Strides before and after turn events were extracted and compared to respective average of all strides. Coefficient of variation (CoV) of stride length and stride time was calculated for entire set of strides, segments between turns and as cumulative values. Their variance and congruency was used to estimate the number of strides required to reliably assess the magnitude of stride variability. Results: Non-detection of turns in 5.8% of HE lead to falsely increased CoV for these individuals. Even after exclusion of these, strides before/after turns tended to be spatially shorter and temporally longer in all groups, contributing to an increase of CoV at group level and widening of confidence margins with increasing numbers of strides. This could be attenuated by a more generous turn excision as an alternative approach. Correlation analyses revealed excellent consistency for CoVs after at most 20 strides in all groups. Respective stride counts were even lower in patients using a more generous turn excision. Conclusion: Including turns to increase continuous walking distance in spatially confined settings does not necessarily improve the validity and reliability of gait variability measures. Specifically with gait pathology, perturbations of stride characteristics before/after algorithmically excised turns were observed that may increase gait variability with this paradigm. We conclude that shorter distance walks of around 15 strides suffice for reliable and valid recordings of gait variability in the groups studied here.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait, Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia",Wearable,IMU,,,,,

A classification engine assigns subjects to healthy or Parkinsonian classes. The diagnosis process involves four steps: data pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, data classification and performance evaluation. The selected features are used as inputs of each classifier. Feature selection is achieved through a wrapper approach established using the random forest algorithm. The proposed methodology uses both supervised classification methods including K-nearest neighbour (K-NN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and unsupervised classification methods such as K-means and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an online dataset collected within three different studies is used. This data set includes vGRF measurements collected from eight force sensors placed under each foot of the subjects. Ninety-three patients suffering from Parkinsonâ€™s disease and 72 healthy subjects participated in the experiments. The obtained performances are compared with respect to various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure. The classification performance evaluation is performed using the leave-one-out cross validation. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed methodology to accurately differentiate between PD subjects and healthy subjects. For the purpose of validation, the proposed methodology is also evaluated with an additional dataset including subjects with neurodegenerative diseases (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Huntingtonâ€™s disease (HD)). The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to discriminate PD subjects from subjects with other neurodegenerative diseases with a relatively high accuracy.",>30,,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Force Sensors ,,,,

Detection and early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease are essential in terms of disease progression and treatment process. Parkinson's disease dataset used in this study was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The proposed hybrid machine learning method consists of two stages: i) data pre-processing (over-sampling), ii) classification. The Parkinson's disease dataset (PD dataset) is a two-class dataset. While 192 data belong to normal (healthy) individuals, 564 data belong to the diseased class (PD). The data set has an imbalanced class distribution. To transform this imbalanced dataset to balanced dataset, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) method is used. Then, after converting to a balanced class distribution, Random Forests classification method was used for classification of Parkinson's disease dataset. The PD dataset consists of 753 attributes. Only the random forests classification were classified as 87.037% in the classification of PD dataset, while the proposed hybrid method (the combination of SMOTE and random forests) achieved 94.89% classification success. Obtained results showed that promising resultshad been achieved in discrimination of the PD dataset with this hybrid method.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,

In this work, the Freezing of gait (FoG) from subjects with Parkinson disease has been detected by the logistic regression modeling. To complete this work, first, the acceleration sensor has been placed on the ankle of the patients to get the signals. Second, the features from these acceleration signals have been extracted by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. With the FFT algorithm, the frequency coefficients have been gotten. To diminish the number of features, the statistical measures including variance, maximum amplitude, minimum amplitude, maximum energy, and minimum energy, have been applied to frequency coefficients of these signals. So, for each class (FoG and no- FoG), five parameters have been extracted. Eight patients are having Parkinson disease in the dataset. After feature extraction, the logistic regression modeling has been used to detect the Freezing of gait cases from the dataset. The classification of the accuracy of 81.3% has been achieved in the classification of FoG cases having PD from the acceleration signals. In addition to logistic regression, four different classifiers (Linear SVM, Quadratic SVM, Cubic SVM, and kNN) have been used to classify the FoG cases. The obtained results have shown that the proposed method could be used in the detection and identification of Parkinson disease using only a sensor of acceleration.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

It is mostly affected to the people after the age of 50 years. The disease results in the loss of coordination between brain and muscle; hence the person is disturbed. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the primitive methods for studying the human brain function. It is used for the detection of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders including PD. In this paper, we reported a study of the frontal and temporal EEG of Parkinson's disease patients using MATLAB platform. Lyapunov exponent and inverse Lyapunov exponent for both PD and healthy subjects were calculated within a given time frame. It was found that for PD subjects, the Lyapunov exponent for the temporal part of the brain is less than that of the frontal while the inverse Lyapunov exponent is reverse order of the brain.

We acoustically characterized 11,942 recordings from 6531 US-based participants using 307 dysphonia measures. We selected a robust subset of 30 dysphonia measures using Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO). We projected the data onto a two-dimensional representation using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to facilitate visual exploration, and used hierarchical clustering to understand data homogeneity. We demonstrate that there is considerable overlap in the projected feature space between PD and HC, making the binary classification task particularly challenging. The data was grouped into nine clusters using hierarchical clustering which was in broad agreement with the projected two-dimensional representation. These results provide some new insights into understanding the new challenges posed in the PVI project where acoustic recordings conditions were not controlled.",,Existing Dataset,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

As the amount of dopamine decreases, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease emerge. Parkinson's disease is a slow-developing disease, and symptoms such as hands, arms, legs, chin and face tremors are increasing over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty in walking and speaking. There is no definitive treatment for Parkinson's disease; however, with the help of some drugs, the symptoms of the disease can be reduced. Although there is no definitive treatment for Parkinson's disease, the patient can continue his normal life by controlling the problems caused by the disease. At this point, it is important to prevent early detection and progression of the disease. In this study, different types of classification methods such as Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest are compared in order to predict Parkinson's disease. A total of 1208 speech data sets consisting of 26 features obtained from Parkinson's patients and non-patients were used in the classification stage. The feature space of the dataset is expanded due to correlation maps. These correlation maps are constructed with the features which are obtained by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Information Gain (IG) and all features respectively.

This study proposes a methodology to model such difficulties to start or to stop movements considering information from speech, handwriting, and gait. We used those transitions to train convolutional neural networks to classify patients and healthy subjects. The neurological state of the patients was also evaluated according to different stages of the disease (initial, intermediate, and advanced). In addition, we evaluated the robustness of the proposed approach when considering speech signals in three different languages: Spanish, German, and Czech. According to the results, the fusion of information from the three modalities is highly accurate to classify patients and healthy subjects, and it shows to be suitable to assess the neurological state of the patients in several stages of the disease. We also aimed to interpret the feature maps obtained from the deep learning architectures with respect to the presence or absence of the disease and the neurological state of the patients. As far as we know, this is one of the first works that considers multimodal information to assess Parkinson's disease following a deep learning approach.",,,Diagnosis,"Speech Topics, Limb movements, Gait","Wearable, Audio Recording, Other",,"Microphone, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Sensors in Tablet",,,,
Deep Learning-Based Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Classification Using Vocal Feature Sets,H. Gunduz,2019,IEEE Access,Convolutional neural networks;deep learning;health informatics;Parkinsonâ€™s disease classification;vocal features,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with multiple motor and non-motor characteristics. PD patients commonly face vocal impairments during the early stages of the disease. So, diagnosis systems based on vocal disorders are at the forefront on recent PD detection studies. Our study proposes two frameworks based on Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Parkinson's Disease (PD) using sets of vocal (speech) features. Although, both frameworks are employed for the combination of various feature sets, they have difference in terms of combining feature sets. While the first framework combines different feature sets before given to 9-layered CNN as inputs, whereas the second framework passes feature sets to the parallel input layers which are directly connected to convolution layers. Thus, deep features from each parallel branch are extracted simultaneously before combining in the merge layer. Proposed models are trained with dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning repository and their performances are validated with Leave-One-Person-Out Cross Validation (LOPO CV). Due to imbalanced class distribution in our data, F-Measure and Matthews Correlation Coefficient metrics are used for the assessment along with accuracy. Experimental results show that the second framework seems to be very promising, since it is able to learn deep features from each feature set via parallel convolution layers. Extracted deep features are not only successful at distinguishing PD patients from healthy individuals but also effective in boosting up the discriminative power of the classifiers.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,
Parkinsonâ€™s disease detection using modulation components in speech signals,J. F. Moofarry; M. Sarria-Paja; J. R. Orozco-Arroyave,2019,"2019 XXII Symposium on Image, Signal Processing and Artificial Vision (STSIVA)",Parkinsonâ€™s disease;Modulation components;covariance features,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's. This disorder affects around 2% of elderly population. In Colombia, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease is around 172 cases per 100.000 inhabitants. Furthermore, around 89% of people diagnosed with PD also suffer from speech disorders. This has motivated many advances in speech signal processing for PD patients which allows to perform assisted diagnosis and also monitor the progression of the disease. In this paper, we propose to use slow varying information from speech signals, also known as modulation components, and combine it with an approach to effectively reduce the number of features to be used in a classification system. The proposed approach achieves around 90% accuracy, outperforming the classical mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) approach. Results show that information in slow varying components is highly discriminative to support assisted diagnosis for PD.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,,,

Vieira; A. O. Andrade,2019,2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),Postural tremor;Parkinsonâ€™s disease;Non-contact capacitive sensor;Frequency analysis,"Parkinsonian tremor manifests in different types: rest, postural, and action tremors. The postural tremor occurs while a body part is held straight out from the body in a stable position against gravity. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which is a subjective assessment performed by the qualitative judgment of neurologists, is the clinical standard for parkinsonian tremor assessment. Despite the common use of subjective methods, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are largely used in many studies as a motion capture system to objective assessment of tremors. However, this kind of sensor must be attached to the patient's body, it limits the patient's movements and requires specific techniques for correct positioning in the limb. In this sense, non-contact capacitive (NCC) sensors are an alternative proposed in this research to record the motor activity of the hand and wrist during a pose against gravity. In order to assess the postural tremor and evaluate this novel sensing technology, data from ten subjects, five with Parkinson's disease (PD) and five neurologically healthy (H) matched in age and sex, were collected. We analyzed the instantaneous mean frequency (IMNF) of the signals from NCC and gyroscope sensors for both groups. The selected descriptive statistical variables allowed discrimination (p <; 0.05) among subjects from H and PD groups while using the gyroscope or the NCC sensor. The obtained results indicate that the NCC sensor can measure the postural hand tremor, and also that frequency features extracted from the collected signals can be used to discriminate subjects from both groups.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor,Wearable,,"Non-contact capacitive sensors, Gyroscope",,,,

Since the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is difficult, researchers have worked to develop a support tool based on algorithms to separate healthy controls from PD patients. Online handwriting dynamic signals can provide more detailed and complex information for PD detection task. Existing techniques often depended on hand-crafted features that required expert knowledge of the field. In this paper, it is suggested to learn pen-based features by means of deep learning for automatic classification of PD. For this purpose, a visual representation of the time series can be computed and used at the input of a convolutional neural network (CNN) as in [4]. Classically, the time series is transformed into a fixed dimension image applying normalization on the time dimension. In this work we have experimented several visual representations, including the spectrogram where normalization of the time scale is applied after short term information has been extracted locally. We have been able to show that considering the local short term information allows the deep learning models to provide better classification results compared to a globally normalized fixed dimension visual representation. For validation purpose, a CNN-BLSTM was directly applied on the time series, without any normalization of the time scale which led to best performance equivalent to the one obtained on spectrogram representation.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Other,,"SmartPen (X,Y,Z accelerations, pressure, altitude, azimuth)",,,,

Liang,2019,IEEE Access,Parkinsonâ€™s diseases;deviation;accumulation angle;radial Bayesian network;perceptual color representation- based classifier,"Functional tremors are clear symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases; as such, they indicate the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Digitized handwritten pattern analysis of Archimedes' spirals, words, and sentences can help evaluate movement discords in the upper limbs. It offers a simple, comfortable, and repeatable method of examination for clinical applications and at-home monitoring usages. Upper limb tremors can be found in PD, essential tremor (ET), and cerebellar disorders. This paper proposes a quantitative method to scale the variations of functional tremors. The deviation (in cm) and the accumulation angle (in rad) of the feature pattern in polar expression were extracted to scale the variability at different tremor levels. Then, the proposed intelligent classifier, which is used as a perceptual color representation-based classifier (PCRC) and comprises a radial Bayesian network and a color relation analysis method, was employed to screen PD or ET with perceptual color representation. An assistant tool can integrate a smart mobile device (iPad/smartphone) and PCRC into the decision support system for individualized functions to evaluate the progression of the tremor level. The proposed decision support system was validated using data collected from 50 subjects. With fivefold cross-validation, average true positive, average true negative, and hit rates of 92.02%, 88.17% and 90.44%, respectively, were obtained to quantify the performance of the proposed classifier for identifying normal controls and PD or ET.",,,Diagnosis,Tremor,Smartphone,,,,,,
Automated Detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Based on Multiple Types of Sustained Phonations Using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Genetically Optimized Neural Network,L. Ali; C. Zhu; Z. Zhang; Y. Liu,2019,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,Dimensionality reduction;genetic algorithm;hyper-parameter optimization;linear discriminant analysis;Parkinsonâ€™s disease;deep neural network,"Objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder. It is reported that most of PD patients have voice impairments. But these voice impairments are not perceptible to common listeners. Therefore, different machine learning methods have been developed for automated PD detection. However, these methods either lack generalization and clinically significant classification performance or face the problem of subject overlap. Methods: To overcome the problems discussed above, we attempt to develop a hybrid intelligent system that can automatically perform acoustic analysis of voice signals in order to detect PD. The proposed intelligent system uses linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and genetic algorithm (GA) for hyperparameters optimization of neural network (NN) which is used as a predictive model. Moreover, to avoid subject overlap, we use leave one subject out (LOSO) validation. Results: The proposed method namely LDA-NN-GA is evaluated in numerical experiments on multiple types of sustained phonations data in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthew correlation coefficient. It achieves classification accuracy of 95% on training database and 100% on testing database using all the extracted features. However, as the dataset is imbalanced in terms of gender, thus, to obtain unbiased results, we eliminated the gender dependent features and obtained accuracy of 80% for training database and 82.14% for testing database, which seems to be more unbiased results. Conclusion: Compared with the previous machine learning methods, the proposed LDA-NN-GA method shows better performance and lower complexity. Clinical Impact: The experimental results suggest that the proposed automated diagnostic system has the potential to classify PD patients from healthy subjects. Additionally, in future the proposed method can also be exploited for prodromal and differential diagnosis, which are considered challenging tasks.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

By using genetic programming, we aim to develop descriptive symbolic nonlinear models of PD patient gait from time series data recorded from pressure sensors under subjects' feet. When compared to popular types of linear regression (OLS and LASSO), the nonlinear models fit their data better and generalize to unseen data significantly better. It was found that models developed for healthy control subjects generalized to other control subjects well, however the models trained on subjects with PD did not generalize well to other PD patients, which complicates the issue of being able to detect the progression of the disease. It is suspected that health care professionals can have difficulty classifying PD due to a lack of accurate data from patient reports; having individually trained models for active monitoring of patients would help in effectively diagnosing PD.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Pressure sensor,,,,

Jimenez-Shahed,2019,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Parkinsons disease;activities of daily living dynamics;sensor fusion;time-frequency analysis;tensor decomposition;pattern classification,"Motor fluctuations are a frequent complication in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) where the response to medication fluctuates between ON states (medication working) and OFF states (medication has worn off). This paper describes a new data analysis approach that can be used along with two wearable IMU (inertial measurement units) sensors to continuously assess motor fluctuations in PD patients while moving in their natural environment. We hypothesized that joint analysis of the sensor data in its spectral, temporal and sensor domain could generate multilevel features that can be used to detect PD-related patterns successfully as the subject's motor state fluctuates between medication ON and OFF states. For this purpose, we utilized time-frequency (TF) representation and multiway data analysis tools (i.e., tensor decomposition) to decompose the TF representation of the two sensors' data into its multilevel structures, which were next used to extract multilevel features representing the PD symptoms in different medication states. The extracted multilevel features were used in a classification model based on support vector machine to detect medication ON and OFF states. For comparison purposes, we implemented a traditional feature extraction method. We also developed a hierarchical feature extraction method based on the combination of those two methods. The performances of the three methods were evaluated using a dataset of 19 PD subjects with a total duration of 17.54 hours. The multilevel features achieved 8.25% improvement in the accuracy over the traditional features, and the hierarchical features resulted in 10.73% improvement indicating that our approach holds great promise to continuously detect medication states from continuous monitoring of the subjects' movement. Such information can be used by the treating physician to tailor the adjustments to each subject's unique impairment(s), thereby improving therapeutic decision-making and patient outcomes.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

This system uses the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) for hand tracking and the Oculus Rift for a fully immersive experience. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the capabilities of our VR-BBT to reliably measure the manual dexterity in a sample of PD patients. For this study, a group of nine individuals in mild to moderate stage of PD were recruited. Participants were asked to perform both the physical BBT and the VR-BBT systems. Correlation analysis of collected data was carried out comparing the BBT and VR-BBT assessments. The test-retest reliability was also explored for the scores gathered with the virtual tool. Statistical analysis proved that the performance data collected by the game-like system correlated with the validated measures of the physical BBT, with a strong test-retest reliability.

Missing data has shown particularly problematic for remotely diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) using smartphones. This contribution presents multi-source ensemble learning, a methodology which combines dataset deconstruction with ensemble learning and enables participants with incomplete data (i.e., where not all sensor data is available) to be included in the training of machine learning models and achieves a 100% participant retention rate. We demonstrate the proposed method on a cohort of 1513 participants, 91.2% of which contributed incomplete data in tapping, gait, voice, and/or memory tests. The use of multi-source ensemble learning, alongside convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capitalizing on the amount of available data, increases PD classification accuracy from 73.1% to 82.0% as compared to traditional techniques. The increase in accuracy is found to be partly caused by the use of multi-channel CNNs and partly caused by developing models using the large cohort of participants. Furthermore, through bootstrap sampling we reveal that feature selection is better performed on a large cohort of participants with incomplete data than on a small number of participants with complete data. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of wearable/remote monitoring datasets that suffer from missing data and contributes to improving the ability to remotely monitor PD via revealing novel methods of accounting for symptom heterogeneity.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,,Wearable/audio,,,,,,Also Diagnosis

In this context, Parkinsons Disease (PD) has received particular attention in that it is a severe and progressive neurodegenerative disease and, therefore, early diagnosis would provide more prompt and effective intervention strategies. This, in turn, would successfully influence the life expectancy of the patients. However, the acceptance of computer-based diagnosis by doctors is hampered by the black-box approach implemented by the most performing systems, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, which do not explicit the rules adopted by the system. In this context, we propose a Cartesian Genetic Programming, aimed at automatically identify PD through the analysis of handwriting performed by PD patients and healthy controls. The use of such approach is particularly interesting in that it allows to infer explicit models of classification and, at same time, to automatically identify a suitable subset of features relevant for a correct diagnosis. The approach has been evaluated on the features extracted from the handwriting samples contained in the publicly available PaHaW dataset.

Efficient and early prediction of people having PD is a key issue to improve patient's quality of life. The diagnosis of PD specifically in its initial stages is extremely complex and time-consuming. Thus, the accurate and efficient diagnosis of PD has been a significant challenge for medical experts and practitioners. In order to tackle this issue and to accurately diagnosis the patient of PD, we proposed a machine-learning-based prediction system. In the development of the proposed system, the support vector machine (SVM) was used as a predictive model for the prediction of PD. The L1-norm SVM of features selection was used for appropriate and highly related features selection for accurate target classification of PD and healthy people. The L1-norm SVM produced a new subset of features from the PD dataset based on a feature weight value. For the validation of the proposed system, the K-fold cross-validation method was used. In addition, the metrics of performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and execution time, were computed for model performance evaluation. The PD dataset was in this paper. The optimal accuracy achieved the best subset of the selected features that might be due to various contributions of the PD features. The experimental findings of this paper suggest that the proposed method can be used to accurately predict the PD and can be easily incorporated in healthcare for diagnosis purpose. Currently, the computer-based assisted predictive system is playing an important role to assist in PD recognition.

Liu,2019,IEEE Access,Balanced accuracy;machine learning;oversampling;Parkinsonâ€™s disease;undersampling,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Till now, there is no definitive clinical examination that can diagnose a PD patient. However, it has been reported that PD patients face deterioration in handwriting. Hence, different computer vision and machine learning researchers have proposed micrography and computer vision based methods. But, these methods possess two main problems. The first problem is biasedness in models caused by imbalanced data i.e. machine learning models show good performance on majority class but poor performance on minority class. Unfortunately, previous studies neither discussed this problem nor took any measures to avoid it. In order to highlight the biasedness in the constructed models and practically demonstrate it, we develop four different machine learning models. To alleviate the problem of biasedness, we propose to use random undersampling method to balance the training process. The second problem is low rate of classification accuracy which has limited clinical significance. To improve the PD detection accuracy, we propose a cascaded learning system that cascades a Chi2 model with adaptive boosting (Adaboost) model. The Chi2 model ranks and selects a subset of relevant features from the feature space while Adaboost model is used to predict PD based on the subset of features. Experimental results confirm that the proposed cascaded system shows better performance than other six similar cascaded systems that used six different state of the art machine learning models. Moreover, it was also observed that the proposed cascaded system improves the strength of conventional Adaboost model by 3.3% and reduces its complexity. Additionally, the cascaded system achieved classification accuracy of 76.44%, sensitivity of 70.94% and specificity of 81.94%.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Images,,,,,,

Especially for large data sets, efficient analysis pipelines are required. Pre-segmentation of long time series into chunks of interest is a possible approach to increase efficiency. Therefore, we developed an unsupervised algorithm for the detection of gait sequences from continuous sensor signals. In the proposed method, gyroscope signals representing the angular rate of the feet are analyzed in the frequency domain using moving windows. A gait sequence was detected, if the frequency spectrum of a given window contained harmonic frequencies. The approach was tested on two data sets that differed in the ratio of clinical gait and cyclic movement tests. Sensitivity in both data sets was higher than 99% in a stride-to-stride comparison with ground truth. The specificity was measured with 76.1% (data set 1) and 94.5% (data set 2) for tests against sequences of other cyclic movements. In conclusion, the algorithm offers a reliable and efficient approach for the detection of gait sequences in time series data and is also promising for the application in long-term home-monitoring scenarios.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

In this paper, a new algorithm was employed to define the best combination of sensor position, axis, sampling window length, and features to predict FoG. We hypothesized that gait deterioration before FoG onsets can be discriminated from normal gait using statistical analysis of features from successive windows of data collected from lower-limb accelerometers. We defined a new performance measure, â€œpredictivityâ€, to compare the number of correctly predicted FoG events among different combinations. We characterized the system performance using data from 10 PD patients, who experienced FoG while performing several walking tasks in a lab environment. The analysis of 120 different combinations revealed that prediction of FoG can be realized by using an individual shank sensor and sample entropy calculated from the horizontal forward axis with window length of 2 s (88.8%, 92.5%, and 89.0% for average predictivity, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively).",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

This paper proposes a multimodal approach combining voice and image test to enhance the reliability of detecting PD patients. To substantiate this idea, we have evaluated both voice and spiral test data using various machine learning models. The results based on the two types of dataset demonstrate an excellent level of accuracy for PD identification. Pairwise correlation and k-means clustering techniques are used to extract features from the vocal dataset. In this classification problem, the highest accuracy of 95.89% is obtained using an ensemble of 3 classification models. The Pearson's correlation is used to extract features from the image dataset. The best accuracy of 99.6% is achieved using the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). An accuracy of 98.8% and 94.9% are achieved using the Logistic Regression classifier and the Adaptive Boosting classifier on the Static Spiral Test (SST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP), respectively.

We have developed an embedded wearable device integrating a tri-axial accelerometer, a tri-axial gyroscope, and a tri-axial magnetometer, realizing a sensor with embedded data fusion and aggregation algorithms. Two different classification and detection algorithms are implemented to provide a comprehensive description and objective quantification of the two most investigated PD's symptoms as tremor and Freezing of gait (FoG). The system is usable in clinical and diagnostic settings showing its effectiveness above all in patients home monitoring through the upload in Cloud and the real-time processing of the acquired data. In the latter case, it allows the detection and objectification of PD symptoms manifested by the patient in everyday life, thereby providing the doctor with essential information for the dosage and effective personalization of drug therapy. For the system validation, a series of tests were carried out according to a defined experimental protocol on a sample of PD patients and healthy subjects with the presence of a video recording system and under the supervision of a neurologists team. The results obtained show a system's accuracy of 97.7% for tremor classification and 99.7% for FoG events detection.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor and FoG,Wearable,,IMU,,,,

Identifying segments of the signal that adhere to the protocol assumptions is typically performed manually by experts. This process is costly, time consuming, and often infeasible for large-scale data sets. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify the segments of signals that violate the test protocol with a high accuracy. In our approach, the signal is first split into variable duration segments by fitting an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) to the frames of the signals in the mel-frequency cepstral domain. The complexity of the iHMM is capable of growing jointly with the data allowing us to infer a potentially large (asymptotically infinite) number of different phenomena segmented into different hidden states. Then, we identify the segments that adhere to the test protocol by applying a multinomial naive Bayes classifier to the state indicators of segments. The experimental results show that even by using a small amount of training data, we can achieve around 96% accuracy in identifying short-term protocol violations with a 0.2 s resolution.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

These patients benefit from wearable FoG detection systems that provide timely biofeedback cues and hence help them regain control over their gait. Unfortunately, the systems proposed thus far are bulky and obtrusive when worn. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the first integration of an FoG detection system into a single sensor node. To achieve such an integration, features with low computational load are selected and dedicated hardware is designed that limits area and memory utilization. Classification is achieved with a neural network that is capable of learning in real time and thus allows the system to adapt to a patient during runtime. A small form factor FPGA implements the feature extraction and classification, whereas a custom PCB integrates the system into a single node. The system fits into a 4.5 Ã— 3.5 Ã— 1.5 cm3 housing case, weighs 32 g, and achieves 95.6% sensitivity and 90.2% specificity when adapted to a patient. Biofeedback cues are provided either through auditory or somatosensory means and the system can remain operational for longer than 9 h while providing cues. The proposed system is highly competitive in terms of classification performance and excels with respect to wearability and real-time patient adaptivity.",,,Rehabilitation,Freezing of gait,"Wearable, Cueing",,,,,,Also Prognosis/Monitoring

The majority of PD patients is associated with handwriting abnormalities called PD dysgraphia, which is linked with rigidity and bradykinesia of muscles involved in the handwriting process. One of the effective approaches of quantitative PD dysgraphia analysis is based on online handwriting processing. In the frame of this study we aim to deeply evaluate and optimize advanced PD handwriting quantification based on fractional order derivatives (FD). For this purpose, we used 37 PD patients and 38 healthy controls from the PaHaW (PD handwriting database). The FD based features were employed in classification and regression analysis (using gradient boosted trees), and evaluated in terms of their discrimination power and abilities to assess severity of PD. The results suggest that the most discriminative and descriptive information provide FD based features extracted from a repetitive loop task or a sentence copy task (maximum sensitivity/specificity = 76 %, error in severity assessment = 14 %, error in PD duration estimation = 22 %). Next, we identified two optimal ranges for the order of fractional derivative, Î± = 0.05-0.45 and Î± = 0.65-0.80. Finally, we observed that inclusion of pressure, azimuth, and tilt together with kinematic features into mathematical modeling has no influence (positive or negative) on classification performance, however, there was a notable improvement in the estimation of PD duration.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Images,,,,,,

This study aims to a deeper insight into pathophysiological mechanisms associated with balance disorders in PD patients, under and not under dopaminergic treatment, through muscle synergy analysis. Ten patients with PD and ten age-matched healthy subjects were exposed to external perturbations around the vertical axis (yaw perturbations). PD patients were evaluated twice, both under their usual dopaminergic therapy (ON) and after a medication washout period of 12 hours (OFF). Two different external perturbations were provided using the RotoBit1D. Muscle activities of 12 bilateral muscles of the upper body were gathered through surface electromyography. To extract muscles synergies, the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization was performed and the Variability Account For was used to assess the minimum Number of Synergies (NoS). Mean, standard error and Coefficient of Variability (CoV) of the total Variability Account For (tVAF) for synergies from 1 to the maximum NoS found were considered. No statistical differences were found considering the NoS that ranged from 2 to 7 among all participants. Statistical differences were found in the tVAF between PD patients and healthy subjects. No statistical differences were found between PD patients OFF and ON state of therapy for all NoS. Finally, the minimum NoS of PD strongly correlated with specific clinical evaluation scores, such as cognitive function and bradykinesia. These findings unveiled poor balance control strategies in PD patients, depending on cognitive and motor impairment and not responding to dopaminergic treatment.",<=10,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,EMG abnormalities,BioPotential,,EMG,,,,

Speech stimuli were recorded from 11 Parkinsonian and 10 age-matched normal control participants under different amplification and environmental conditions. Quality ratings of the recorded stimuli were obtained from naÃ¯ve listeners. For objective assessment, feature vectors were derived from the speech recordings based on temporal, spectral, and/or cepstral parametrization. These feature vectors were subsequently mapped to the predicted quality scores through several regression methods, including support vector regression, Gaussian process regression, and deep learning. Analyses of subjective speech quality ratings showed that Parkinsonian speech quality was significantly poorer than control subjects' speech quality, and that the amplification devices differentially affected perceived quality of Parkinsonian speech. Objective analyses revealed disparity in performance among feature vectors and mappers, with some feature vector and mapper combinations exhibiting statistically similar correlations with subjective ratings. A set consisting of cepstral, spectral, and modulation domain speech features when combined with Gaussian process regression or deep learning resulted in the highest correlation of 0.85 with the subjective data.",,,Diagnosis,,Audio Recording,,,,,,

Thus, a frequent and objective PD assessment is highly valuable for effective health management of people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). Here, we propose a method for monitoring PwP by stochastically modeling the relationships between wrist movements during unscripted daily activities and corresponding annotations about clinical displays of movement abnormalities. We approach the estimation of PD motor signs by independently modeling and hierarchically stacking Gaussian process models for three classes of commonly observed movement abnormalities in PwP including tremor, (non-tremulous) bradykinesia, and (non-tremulous) dyskinesia. We use clinically adopted severity measures as annotations for training the models, thus allowing our multi-layer Gaussian process prediction models to estimate not only their presence but also their severities. The experimental validation of our approach demonstrates strong agreement of the model predictions with these PD annotations. Our results show that the proposed method produces promising results in objective monitoring of movement abnormalities of PD in the presence of arbitrary and unknown voluntary motions, and makes an important step toward continuous monitoring of PD in the home environment.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Tremor, Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia",Wearable,,,,,,
A Novel Positive Transfer Learning Approach for Telemonitoring of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease,H. Yoon; J. Li,2019,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Machine learning;negative transfer;telemonitoring;transfer learning (TL),"Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices to remotely monitor patients. Taking the Parkinson's disease (PD) as an example, the use of at-home testing device (AHTD) enables remote, internet-based measurement of PD vocal symptoms. Translating AHTD measurement into a unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) through predictive analytics enables cost-effective, convenient, and close tracking of PD progression. Building a predictive model between AHTD measurement and UPDRS is not straightforward because PD patients are highly heterogeneous, which requires patient-specific models. Learning a patient-specific model faces the challenge of limited data. Transfer learning (TL) tackles this challenge by leveraging other patients' information to make up the data shortage when modeling a target patient. Among different TL methods, the category of parameter transfer methods is more appropriate for the telemonitoring application because it transfers patient-specific model parameters but not patients' data. However, existing parameter transfer methods fall short because not every other patient's information is helpful and blind transfer causes the problem of negative transfer. To tackle this limitation, we propose a positive TL (PTL) method. We provide an in-depth theoretical study on the risk and condition for negative transfer to happen, which further drive the development of novel PTL algorithms that are robust to negative transfer. We apply PTL to predict UPDRS of 42 PD patients using their AHTD vocal measurement. PTL achieves significantly better accuracy compared with single learning and one-model-fits-all approaches.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

As a biomarker to detect FOG, the Freeze index (FI), which is defined as the ratio of the areas under power spectra in `freeze' band and in `locomotion' band, can negatively be affected by poor time and frequency resolution of time-frequency spectrum estimate when short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or Wavelet transform (WT) is used. In this study, a novel high-resolution parametric time-frequency spectral estimation method is proposed to improve the accuracy of FI. A time-varying autoregressive moving average model (TV-ARMA) is first identified where the time-varying parameters are estimated using an asymmetric basis function expansion method. The TV-ARMA model is then transformed into frequency domain to estimate the time-frequency spectrum and calculate the FI. Results evaluated on the Daphnet Freezing of gait Dataset show that the new method improves the time and frequency resolutions of the time-frequency spectrum and the associate FI has better performance in the detection of FOG than its counterparts based on STFT and WT methods do. Moreover, FOGs can be predicted in advance of its occurrence in most cases using the new method.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

Once a FoG event is detected, these systems generate a sequence of rhythmic stimuli to allow the patient restarting the march. While these solutions are effective in detecting FoG events, they are unable to predict FoG to prevent its occurrence. This paper fills in the gap by presenting a machine learning-based approach that classifies accelerometer data from PD patients, recognizing a pre-FOG phase to further anticipate FoG occurrence in advance. Gait was monitored by three tri-axial accelerometer sensors worn on the back, hip and ankle. Gait features were then extracted from the accelerometer's raw data through data windowing and non-linear dimensionality reduction. A k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was used to classify gait in three classes of events: pre-FoG, no-FoG and FoG. The accuracy of the proposed solution was compared to state of-the-art approaches. Our study showed that: (i) we achieved performances overcoming the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of FoG detection, (ii) we were able, for the very first time in the literature, to predict FoG by identifying the pre-FoG events with an average sensitivity and specificity of, respectively, 94.1% and 97.1%, and (iii) our algorithm can be executed on resource-constrained devices.

Since accuracy and precision of the measures are mandatory to provide the neurologist with a tool that can actually be applied in clinical practice, in this work, the quality of measures obtained by the SensHand system was evaluated, comparing them to an optoelectronic â€œgold standardâ€ system addressing a preliminary technical validation. Three exercises (i.e., finger tapping, thumb-forefinger tapping, and pronosupination) were selected and frequency, number of repetitions and amplitude of the movements were measured for each of them by both the wearable and optical systems. The preliminary results were very satisfying, considering that discrepancies, measured as absolute error, in frequency evaluation, number of repetitions, and amplitude movement were, on average, equal to 0.03 taps/s(min 0.02, max 0.05), 0.07 tap (min 0.02, max 0.13), and 3.8 degrees (min 1.81, max 7.47), respectively.

However, most contributions deal with PD speech, with significantly fewer results presented for ALS speech. The objective of this paper is to show that ALS speech has a similar statistical distribution as PD speech, with the complex spectral coefficients being significantly less super-Gaussian than healthy speech spectral coefficients. In addition, a method to exploit the super-Gaussianity of speech signals as a feature to classify healthy and dysarthric speech is presented and evaluated. The proposed approach is evaluated on a French database of healthy and dysarthric (PD and ALS) speech.

Feng,2019,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Parkinson's disease;Freezing of gait detection;deep learning;graph convolution neural network,"Parkinson's disease significantly impacts the life quality of millions of people around the world. While Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most common symptoms of the disease, it is time-consuming and subjective to assess FoG for well-trained experts. Therefore, it is highly desirable to devise computer-aided FoG detection methods for the purpose of objective and time-efficient assessment. In this study, in line with the gold standard of FoG clinical assessment which requires video or direct observation, we propose one of the first vision-based methods for automatic FoG detection. To better characterize FoG patterns, instead of learning an overall representation of a video, we propose a novel architecture of graph convolution neural network and represent each video as a directed graph where FoG related candidate regions are the vertices. A weakly-supervised learning strategy and a weighted adjacency matrix estimation layer are proposed to eliminate the resource expensive data annotation required for fully supervised learning. As a result, the interference of visual information irrelevant to FoG, such as gait motion of supporting staff involved in clinical assessments, has been reduced to improve FoG detection performance by identifying the vertices contributing to FoG events. To further improve the performance, the global context of a clinical video is also considered and several fusion strategies with graph predictions are investigated. Experimental results on more than 100 videos collected from 45 patients during a clinical assessment demonstrated promising performance of our proposed method with an AUC of 0.887.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Video Recording,,,,,,

The sensor enables estimation of the distance between the two coil-bearing fingertips according to the nonlinear relationships between voltage and distance. The finger movements measured are evaluated by computing 12 indices, such as the FT interval and maximum amplitude, and radar charts of the evaluation indices are then displayed in real time on a monitor. The user can thus intuitively understand the features of FT movements. Verification experiments on magnetic measurement of finger movements were performed, and the results showed that finger movement could be measured with a high degree of accuracy. The results of finger movement evaluation for 30 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 32 normal elderly subjects showed that all evaluation indices differed significantly for each group, and the proposed system could be used to assess the Unified PD Rating Scale part III FT score by evaluating the number of indices with values greater or smaller than plus/minus double the standard deviation from the measured data of 32 normal elderly subjects. We therefore concluded that the proposed system can be used to quantitatively evaluate the motor function of finger taps.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,,,Magnetic sensor,,,,

Towards Disease-specific Speech Markers for Differential Diagnosis in Parkinsonism,B. Das; K. Daoudi; J. Klempir; J. Rusz,2019,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",Pathological speech processing;Speech disorder;Parkinsonism;Parkinsonâ€™s disease;Machine learning,"Parkinsonism refers to Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes (APS), such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). Discrimination between PD and APS and within APS groups in early disease stages is a very challenging task. Interestingly, speech disorder is frequently an early and prominent clinical feature of both PD and APS. This renders speech/voice analysis a promising tool for the development of an objective marker to assist neurologists in their diagnosis. This paper is a continuation of a recent work on speech-based differential diagnosis within APS. We address the difficult problem of defining disease-specific speech features which is crucial in the perspective of early differential diagnosis. We investigate this problem by considering the constraint that only a small amount of training data can be available in this setting. To do so, we perform univariate statistical analysis followed by a supervised learning that forces the designed new features to be 1-dimensional. We carry out experiments using speech recordings of MSA and PSP patients. We show that linear classification models allow the definition of new scalar variables which can be considered as speech features which are specific to each disease, MSA and PSP.",,,Diagnosis,Speech Topics,Audio Recording,,,,,,

A Novel Deep Learning Strategy for Classifying Different Attack Patterns for Deep Brain Implants,H. Rathore; A. K. Al-Ali; A. Mohamed; X. Du; M. Guizani,2019,IEEE Access,Deep brain stimulators;deep learning;implantable medical devices;machine learning;security,"Deep brain stimulators (DBSs), a widely used and comprehensively acknowledged restorative methodology, are a type of implantable medical device which uses electrical stimulation to treat neurological disorders. These devices are widely used to treat diseases such as Parkinson, movement disorder, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Security in such devices plays a vital role since it can directly affect the mental, emotional, and physical state of human bodies. In worst-case situations, it can even lead to the patient's death. An adversary in such devices, for instance, can inhibit the normal functionality of the brain by introducing fake stimulation inside the human brain. Nonetheless, the adversary can impair the motor functions, alter impulse control, induce pain, or even modify the emotional pattern of the patient by giving fake stimulations through DBSs. This paper presents a deep learning methodology to predict different attack stimulations in DBSs. The proposed work uses long short-term memory, a type of recurrent network for forecasting and predicting rest tremor velocity. (A type of characteristic observed to evaluate the intensity of the neurological diseases) The prediction helps in diagnosing fake versus genuine stimulations. The effect of deep brain stimulation was tested on Parkinson tremor patients.

Gait fractality tends to disappear in elderly individuals and patients with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Here, we examined influence of a cognitive load on the gait cycle variability. To this end, three walking conditions, including normal walking, walking with watching a smartphone with blank screen (non-cognitive task), and walking with playing a puzzle game of a smartphone (cognitive task). Stride interval variability was characterized by the mean, the standard deviation, and the degree of long-range correlation quantified by the scaling exponent estimated by the detrended fluctuation analysis.

Li,2019,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,Parkinsonian bradykinesia;automatic quantification;human pose estimation,"Non-volitional discontinuation of motion, namely bradykinesia, is a common motor symptom among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Evaluating bradykinesia severity is an important part of clinical examinations on PD patients in both diagnosis and monitoring phases. However, subjective evaluations from different clinicians often show low consistency. The research works that explore objective quantification of bradykinesia are mostly based on highly-integrated sensors. Although these sensor-based methods demonstrate applaudable performance, it is unrealistic to promote them for wide use because the special devices they require are far from popularized in daily lives. In this paper, we take advantage of computer vision and machine learning technologies, proposing a vision-based method to automatically and objectively quantify bradykinesia severity. Three bradykinesia-related items are investigated in our study: finger tapping, hand clasping and hand pro/supination. In our method, human pose estimation technology is utilized to extract kinematic characteristics and supervised-learning-based classifiers are employed to generate score ratings. Clinical experiment on 60 patients shows that the scoring accuracy of our method over 360 examination videos is 89.7%, which is competitive with other related works. The devices our method requires are only a camera for instrumentation and a laptop for data processing. Therefore, our method can produce reliable assessment results on Parkinsonian bradykinesia with minimal device requirement, showing great potential of realizing long-term remote monitoring on patients' condition.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia,Video Recording,,,,,,

Interaction is achieved through various media among which are Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). It is still unclear which mode offers more efficient treatment. In this study, we hypothesized that AR provides a more efficient environment for Upper Limb (UL) motor action. Therefore, the performance of 20 healthy individuals compared in the AR and VR environments while playing a Fruit Ninja game. Simultaneously, the subjects' EEG data were also recorded using a 32-channel system. Our results demonstrated that subjects have a higher score and a faster performance in the AR mode as compared to VR.

Using controlled experiments, we show that limitations of each sensor, such as inference inaccuracy and delay, can be overcome through communication with the other sensors. The model is tested for human action recognition on the UTD-MHAD and MHEALTH datasets and for gait freeze recognition from wearable acceleration sensors in Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients.

The platform is a rhythm game wherein hand gestures are used as input and must match the rhythm and gestures shown on screen, thus allowing a physical therapist to represent an exercise session as a series of patterns involving the user's hand and finger joints. Fine motor rehabilitation plays an important role in the recovery and improvement of the effects of diseases and conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, among many others. Individuals with these conditions possess a wide range of impairments such as fine motor movement. The proposed serious game is adaptive to the player to enable access to patients across a wide range of ability. In two pilot studies in collaboration with the South West Advanced Neurological Rehabilitation (SWAN Rehab) in Phoenix, Arizona, we compared the performance of individuals with fine motor impairment to individuals without impairment to determine the accessibility of the proposed serious game, i.e., to assess whether the platform is adaptive to a user's range of motion to allow an individual with fine motor impairment to perform at a similar level as a non-impaired user.

The objective of this work is to propose a Parkinsonian gait detection system based on an S-band perception technique to classify abnormal gait and normal walking. Due to the differences in the Gaits of Parkinson's patients compared with healthy persons, the wireless signals reflect and generates different variations at the receiver that could be used for SP diagnosis and classification. To detect a Parkinsonian gait, we first implement data preprocessing of the original data to obtain clear amplitude and phase information. Then, the feature extraction is carried out by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm is applied on collected data to classify the abnormal gait of SP patients compared with a normal gait. We evaluate the proposed system with different people, and the experimental outcomes show that the Parkinsonian gait detection of this training-based system achieves a high accuracy of above 90%.

Veltink,2019,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,Ambulatory sensing;extrapolated center of mass;dynamic balance;margin of stability;gait;wearable sensors,"Remote monitoring of gait performance offers possibilities for objective evaluation and tackling impairment in motor ability, gait, and balance in populations, such as elderly, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's. This requires a wearable and unobtrusive system capable of estimating ambulatory gait and balance measures, such as the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) and dynamic margin of stability. These estimations require the knowledge of 3-D forces and moments (F&M) and accurate foot positions. Though an existing ambulatory gait and balance system (AGBS) consisting of 3-D F&M sensors and inertial measurement units can be used for the purpose, it is bulky and conspicuous. Resistive pressure sensors were investigated as an alternative to the onboard 3-D F&M sensors. Subject-specific regression models were built to estimate 3-D F&M from 1-D plantar pressures. The model was applicable for different walking speeds. Different pressure sensor configurations were studied to optimize the system complexity and accuracy. Using resistive sensors only under the toe and heel, we were able to estimate the XCoM with a mean absolute rms error of 2.2Â±0.3 cm in the walking direction while walking at a preferred speed, when compared to the AGBS. For the same case, the XCoM was classified as ahead or behind the base of support correctly at 97.7Â±1.7%. In conclusion, this paper shows that pressure sensors, minimally under the heel and toe, offer a lightweight and inconspicuous alternative for F&M sensing, toward estimating ambulatory gait and dynamic balance.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Wearable,,Pressure,,,,

However, the vast majority of existing commercial and emerging technologies use significant electric power, need multiple sensor nodes, and are expensive and complicated to wear. This paper proposes a customized low power, low-cost monitoring insole (MONI) with minimized sensor nodes for real time daily gait monitoring and analysis in an accurate and reliable manner. With one accelerometer positioned at the heel and one at the first metatarsal, key gait features can be extracted and recorded in real-time. Selected gait information will be constructed as personalized daily gait traces to provide a low-power wearable solution for observing user's gait evolution, which is critical for disease detection at early stages, such as Parkinson's disease. To minimize the power consumption while efficiently collecting scattered gait information throughout the day, a working-mode management (WMM) algorithm, and an auto activity recognition (AAR) algorithm are developed to intelligently sample the right amount of true walking gait data in real-time. MONI is tested and validated both in the lab (with an accuracy of over 88.74% and a strong correlation intra class correlations (ICC) over 0.83).

Wearable sensors do not only provide the opportunity to assess the behavior of patients as it happens in their daily life activities, but also provide quantitative, meaningful feedback data of patients to their therapists. This can pinpoint the cause of problems and help in maximizing their recovery rates. The popularity of using wearable sensors has received attention from a number of researchers from both the academic and industrial fields in the past few years. The different types of wearable sensors have given birth to the realization of a standard measurement model that can support different types of applications. Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are starting to replace traditional healthcare systems by enabling long-term monitoring of patients and tele-rehabilitation, especially those who suffer from chronic diseases. This paper investigates using wearable accelerometers and surface electromyography (EMG) in human locomotion monitoring for tele-rehabilitation. It proposes and investigates new positions for the proposed sensors, and compares the measured signals to similar techniques proposed in the literature. Realistic measurements show that the proposed positions of surface EMG sensors (on the forearm muscles) provide more reliable results in the classification of motion abnormality as compared to the sensor positions proposed in the literature (biceps muscles). Seven statistical features were extracted from accelerometer signals, and four time domain (TD) features are extracted from EMG signals. These features are used to construct six machine learning classifiers for automatic classification of Parkinson&rsquo;s tremor. These models include; decision tree (DT), linear discriminant analysis analysis (LDA), k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), boosted tree and bagged tree classifiers. The performance of the applied classifiers is analyzed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and area under ROC (AUC) curve. The results are also compared to corresponding findings in the literature. The experimental results show that the highest classification accuracy is achieved when using the proposed measurement set and bagged tree classifier with a value of 99.6%.",,,Rehabilitation,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,Accelerometer and electromyograph,,,,

To reduce the initial 93 measures, we selected uncorrelated measures that were most sensitive to PD. After applying a threshold on the Standardized Mean Difference between PD and healthy controls, 44 measures remained; and after reducing highly correlated measures, 24 measures remained.

Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection from Drawing Movements Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Gil-MartÃ­n, Manuel; Montero, Juan; San-Segundo, RubÃ©n",2019,Electronics,Parkinsonâ€™s disease detection; drawing movements; deep learning; convolutional neural networks,"Nowadays, an important research effort in healthcare biometrics is finding accurate biomarkers that allow developing medical-decision support tools. These tools help to detect and supervise illnesses like Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). This paper contributes to this effort by analyzing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for PD detection from drawing movements. This CNN includes two parts: feature extraction (convolutional layers) and classification (fully connected layers). The inputs to the CNN are the module of the Fast Fourier&rsquo;s transform in the range of frequencies between 0 Hz and 25 Hz. We analyzed the discrimination capability of different directions during drawing movements obtaining the best results for X and Y directions. This analysis was performed using a public dataset: Parkinson Disease Spiral Drawings Using Digitized Graphics Tablet dataset.

Towards Real-Time Prediction of Freezing of gait in Patients With Parkinsonâ€™s Disease: Addressing the Class Imbalance Problem,"Naghavi, Nader; Miller, Aaron; Wade, Eric",2019,Sensors,ensemble classifier; data synthesis; ADASYN; cost of classification; Freezing of gait; Parkinsonâ€™s disease; wearable sensors,"Freezing of gait (FoG) is a common motor symptom in patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). FoG impairs gait initiation and walking and increases fall risk. Intelligent external cueing systems implementing FoG detection algorithms have been developed to help patients recover gait after freezing. However, predicting FoG before its occurrence enables preemptive cueing and may prevent FoG. Such prediction remains challenging given the relative infrequency of freezing compared to non-freezing events. In this study, we investigated the ability of individual and ensemble classifiers to predict FoG. We also studied the effect of the ADAptive SYNthetic (ADASYN) sampling algorithm and classification cost on classifier performance. Eighteen PD patients performed a series of daily walking tasks wearing accelerometers on their ankles, with nine experiencing FoG. The ensemble classifier formed by Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multi-Layer Perceptron using bagging techniques demonstrated highest performance (F1 = 90.7) when synthetic FoG samples were added to the training set and class cost was set as twice that of normal gait. The model identified 97.4% of the events, with 66.7% being predicted. This study demonstrates our algorithm&rsquo;s potential for accurate prediction of gait events and the provision of preventive cueing in spite of limited event frequency.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,Also Therapy
Wearable Sensors for Estimation of Parkinsonian Tremor Severity during Free Body Movements,"Hssayeni, Murtadha; Jimenez-Shahed, Joohi; Burack, Michelle; Ghoraani, Behnaz",2019,Sensors,Parkinsonian tremor; continuous monitoring; wearable sensors; gradient tree boosting; deep learning; LSTM,"Tremor is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD) that reduces the quality of life. Tremor is measured as part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III. However, the assessment is based on onsite physical examinations and does not fully represent the patients&rsquo; tremor experience in their day-to-day life. Our objective in this paper was to develop algorithms that, combined with wearable sensors, can estimate total Parkinsonian tremor as the patients performed a variety of free body movements. We developed two methods: an ensemble model based on gradient tree boosting and a deep learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The developed methods were assessed on gyroscope sensor data from 24 PD subjects. Our analysis demonstrated that the method based on gradient tree boosting provided a high correlation (r = 0.96 using held-out testing and r = 0.93 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation) between the estimated and clinically assessed tremor subscores in comparison to the LSTM-based method with a moderate correlation (r = 0.84 using held-out testing and r = 0.77 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation).

This concerns not only the choice of the algorithm and sensors, but methods are often designed to detect tremors in one specific group of patients during the performance of a specific task. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold. First, an objective quantitative method to detect tremor windows (TWs) in accelerometer and electromyography recordings is introduced. Second, the tremor stability index (TSI) is determined to indicate the advantage of detecting TWs prior to analysis. Ten Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) patients, ten essential tremor (ET) patients, and ten healthy controls (HC) performed a resting, postural and movement task. Data was split into 3-s windows, and the power spectral density was calculated for each window. The relative power around the peak frequency with respect to the power in the tremor band was used to classify the windows as either tremor or non-tremor. The method yielded a specificity of 96.45%, sensitivity of 84.84%, and accuracy of 90.80% of tremor detection. During tremors, significant differences were found between groups in all three parameters.

It consists of the integration of two approaches investigated in our previous works, each one appropriate for the movement analysis of specific parts of the body: low-cost optical devices for the upper limbs and wearable sensors for the lower ones. The system performs the automated assessments of six motor tasks of the unified Parkinson&rsquo;s disease rating scale, and it is equipped with a gesture-based human machine interface designed to facilitate the user interaction and the system management. The usability of the system has been evaluated by means of standard questionnaires, and the accuracy of the automated assessment has been verified experimentally.

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether an ambulatory wearable device could predict the LR from the response to the first morning dose. The ON and OFF scores were sorted into six categories of severity so that separating Parkinsonâ€™s Kinetigraph (PKG) features corresponding to the ON and OFF scores became a multi-class classification problem according to whether they fell below or above the threshold for each class. Candidate features were extracted from the PKG data and matched to the class labels. Several linear and non-linear candidate statistical models were examined and compared to classify the six categories of severity. The resulting model predicted a clinically significant LR with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.92. This study shows that ambulatory data could be used to identify a clinically significant response to levodopa. This study has also identified practical steps that would enhance the reliability of this test in future studies.,,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia (Bradykinesia/Dyskinesia),Wearable,,Accelerometer,,,,

This work deals with the analysis of the arm swing by using wearable inertial sensors. A total of 250 records of 39 different subjects were used for this task. Fifteen subjects of this group had motor dysfunctions (MD). The subjects had to perform the standardized Timed Up and Go (TUG) test to ensure that the recordings were comparable. The data were classified by using the wavelet transformation, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and weight voting.

Comparing performance of ML models used in various studies can be problematic due to different walking protocols and gait assessment systems. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of walking protocols and gait assessment systems on the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) for classification of PD. 93 PD and 103 controls performed two walking protocols at their normal pace: (i) four times along a 10 m walkway (intermittent walk-IW), (ii) walking for 2 minutes on a 25 m oval circuit (continuous walk-CW). 14 gait characteristics were extracted from two different systems (an instrumented walkway&mdash;GAITRite; and an accelerometer attached at the lower back&mdash;Axivity). SVM and RF were trained on normalized data (accounting for step velocity, gender, age and BMI) and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation with area under the curve (AUC). Overall performance was higher for both systems during CW compared to IW. SVM performed better than RF. With SVM, during CW Axivity significantly outperformed GAITRite (AUC: 87.83 &plusmn; 7.81% vs. 80.49 &plusmn; 9.85%); during IW systems performed similarly.

However, clinical evaluation may underscore some subtle motor impairments, hidden from the visual inspection of examiners. Technology-based objective measures are more frequently utilized to assess motor performance and objectively measure motor dysfunction. Gait and balance impairments, frequent complications in later disease stages, are poorly responsive to classic dopamine-replacement therapy. Although recent findings suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can have a role in improving motor skills, there is scarce evidence for this, especially considering the difficulty to objectively assess motor function. Therefore, we used wearable electronics to measure motor abilities, and further evaluated the gait and balance features of 10 PD patients, before and (three days and one month) after the tDCS. To assess patients&rsquo; abilities, we adopted six motor tasks, obtaining 72 meaningful motor features. According to the obtained results, wearable electronics demonstrated to be a valuable tool to measure the treatment response.

Cueing Paradigms to Improve Gait and Posture in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease: A Narrative Review,"Muthukrishnan, Niveditha; Abbas, James; Shill, Holly; Krishnamurthi, Narayanan",2019,Sensors,Parkinsonâ€™s disease; cueing; gait; posture; rehabilitation; wearable sensors,"Progressive gait dysfunction is one of the primary motor symptoms in people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). It is generally expressed as reduced step length and gait speed and as increased variability in step time and step length. People with PD also exhibit stooped posture which disrupts gait and impedes social interaction. The gait and posture impairments are usually resistant to the pharmacological treatment, worsen as the disease progresses, increase the likelihood of falls, and result in higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. These impairments may be caused by perceptual deficiencies (poor spatial awareness and loss of temporal rhythmicity) due to the disruptions in processing intrinsic information related to movement initiation and execution which can result in misperceptions of the actual effort required to perform a desired movement and maintain a stable posture. Consequently, people with PD often depend on external cues during execution of motor tasks. Numerous studies involving open-loop cues have shown improvements in gait and Freezing of gait (FoG) in people with PD. However, the benefits of cueing may be limited, since cues are provided in a consistent/rhythmic manner irrespective of how well a person follows them. This limitation can be addressed by providing feedback in real-time to the user about performance (closed-loop cueing) which may help to improve movement patterns. Some studies that used closed-loop cueing observed improvements in gait and posture in PD, but the treadmill-based setup in a laboratory would not be accessible outside of a research setting, and the skills learned may not readily and completely transfer to overground locomotion in the community. Technologies suitable for cueing outside of laboratory environments could facilitate movement practice during daily activities at home or in the community and could strongly reinforce movement patterns and improve clinical outcomes. This narrative review presents an overview of cueing paradigms that have been utilized to improve gait and posture in people with PD and recommends development of closed-loop wearable systems that can be used at home or in the community to improve gait and posture in PD.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait,Cueing,,,,,,

Three sustained phonetic voice recordings, /a/, /u/ and /m/, from 22 CO (mean age = 66.91) and 24 PD (mean age = 71.83) participants were analysed. FD was first computed for PD and CO voice recordings, followed by the computation of NMI between the test groups: PD&ndash;CO, PD&ndash;PD and CO&ndash;CO. Four features reported in the literature&mdash;normalised pitch period entropy (Norm. PPE), glottal-to-noise excitation ratio (GNE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and glottal closing quotient (ClQ)&mdash;were also computed for comparison with the proposed complexity measures. The statistical significance of the features was tested using a one-way ANOVA test. Support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was used to classify the test groups, using a leave-one-out validation method. The results showed that PD voice recordings had lower FD compared to CO (p &lt; 0.008). It was also observed that the average NMI between CO voice recordings was significantly lower compared with the CO&ndash;PD and PD&ndash;PD groups (p &lt; 0.036) for the three phonetic sounds. The average NMI and FD demonstrated higher accuracy (&gt;80%) in differentiating the test groups compared with other speech feature-based classifications. This study has demonstrated that the voices of PD patients has reduced FD, and NMI between voice recordings of PD&ndash;CO and PD&ndash;PD is higher compared with CO&ndash;CO. This suggests that the use of NMI obtained from the sample voice, when paired with known groups of CO and PD, can be used to identify PD voices.

A classification engine assigns subjects to healthy or Parkinsonian classes. The diagnosis process involves four steps: data pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, data classification and performance evaluation. The selected features are used as inputs of each classifier. Feature selection is achieved through a wrapper approach established using the random forest algorithm. The proposed methodology uses both supervised classification methods including K-nearest neighbour (K-NN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), Na&iuml;ve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and unsupervised classification methods such as K-means and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an online dataset collected within three different studies is used.

Nonetheless, the acceptance of AI-based diagnoses by the physicians is hampered by the black-box approach implemented by most performing systems, which do not clearly state the classification rules adopted. Methods: In this framework we propose a classification method based on a Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) approach, which allows for the automatic identification of the presence of the disease, and concurrently, provides the explicit classification model used by the system. Results: The proposed approach has been evaluated on the publicly available HandPD dataset, which contains handwriting samples drawn by Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients and healthy controls. We show that our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods, and more importantly, allows the physician to identify an explicit model relevant for the diagnosis based on the most informative subset of features.

Specifically, we developed a new hybrid feature extraction method to represent the longitudinal changes of motor function from the sensor data. Next, we developed a classification model based on random forest to learn the changes in the patterns of the sensor data as the severity of the motor function changes. We evaluated our algorithm using data from 24 subjects with idiopathic PD as they performed a variety of daily routine activities. A leave-one-subject-out assessment of the algorithm resulted in 83.33% accuracy, indicating that our approach holds a great promise to passively detect degree of motor fluctuation severity from continuous monitoring of an individual&rsquo;s free body movements.

Kin-FOG: Automatic Simulated Freezing of gait (FOG) Assessment System for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease,"Soltaninejad, Sara; Cheng, Irene; Basu, Anup",2019,Sensors,parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD); Freezing of gait (FOG); kinect; simple walking (SW); walking with turning (WWT); standing mode (ST); trajectory; angular displacement,"Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is one of the leading neurological disorders in the world with an increasing incidence rate for the elderly. Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most incapacitating symptoms for PD especially in the later stages of the disease. FOG is a short absence or reduction of ability to walk for PD patients which can cause fall, reduction in patients&rsquo; quality of life, and even death. Existing FOG assessments by doctors are based on a patient&rsquo;s diaries and experts&rsquo; manual video analysis which give subjective, inaccurate, and unreliable results. In the present research, an automatic FOG assessment system is designed for PD patients to provide objective information to neurologists about the FOG condition and the symptom&rsquo;s characteristics. The proposed FOG assessment system uses an RGB-D sensor based on Microsoft Kinect V2 for capturing data for 5 healthy subjects who are trained to imitate the FOG phenomenon. The proposed FOG assessment system is called &ldquo;Kin-FOG&rdquo;. The analysis of foot joint trajectory of the motion captured by Kinect is used to find the FOG episodes. The evaluation of Kin-FOG is performed by two types of experiments, including: (1) simple walking (SW); and (2) walking with turning (WWT). Since the standing mode has features similar to a FOG episode, our Kin-FOG system proposes a method to distinguish between the FOG and standing episodes. Therefore, two general groups of experiments are conducted with standing state (WST) and without standing state (WOST). The gradient displacement of the angle between the foot and the ground is used as the feature for discriminating between FOG and standing modes. These experiments are conducted with different numbers of FOGs for getting reliable and general results. The Kin-FOG system reports the number of FOGs, their lengths, and the time slots when they occur. Experimental results demonstrate Kin-FOG has around 90% accuracy rate for FOG prediction in both experiments for different tasks (SW, WWT). The proposed Kin-FOG system can be used as a remote application at a patient&rsquo;s home or a rehabilitation clinic for sending a neurologist the required FOG information. The reliability and generality of the proposed system will be evaluated for bigger data sets of actual PD subjects.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Motion Tracker,, Microsoft Kinect V2,,,,

In this paper, a new methodology is designed for objective evaluation and automatic scoring of bradykinesia in repetitive finger-tapping movements for patients with idiopathic Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and atypical parkinsonism. The methodology comprises several simple and repeatable signal-processing techniques that are applied for the extraction of important movement features. The decision support system consists of simple rules designed to match universally defined criteria that are evaluated in clinical practice. The accuracy of the system is calculated based on the reference scores provided by two neurologists. The proposed expert system achieved an accuracy of 88.16% for files on which neurologists agreed with their scores.

Medication status and dual-tasking on turning strategies in Parkinson disease,"Adamson, M. B.; Gilmore, G.; Stratton, T. W.; Baktash, N.; Jog, M. S.",2019,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,"Parkinson disease, Gait, Turning strategies, Medication state, Dual-tasking, Movement disorders, Motor control","Background
  Parkinson disease (PD) patients have turning impairments that may increase fall risk. Clinics lack specialized kinematic equipment used in gait and turn analysis and require a simple method to evaluate fall risk and advise patients in turning strategy selection.
  Objectives
  To enhance understanding of PD turning strategies and determine if turning can be assessed using a video-recording and categorization method, we compared 180-degree and 90-degree turns as a function of medication status and dual-tasking (DT).
  Methods
  21 PD participants (H&Y stage 1--3) in PD-ON and PD-OFF medication states and 16 controls completed 180-degree and 90-degree turn-tasks with and without DT. Video-recordings of tasks permitted classification of 180-degree turns into Few-Step turns (FST) vs. Multi-Step turns (MST) and 90-degree turns into Step vs. Spin-turns. FST were further sub-classified into Twisting vs. Sideways turns and MST into Backward, Festination, Forward or Wheeling turns. Percentages of subtypes were analyzed across groups by task.
  Results
  IN 180-degree tasks, there was an effect of group: FST vs. MST F(2,55)â€¯=â€¯9.578, pâ€¯<â€¯.001. PD participants in the off-medication state (PD-OFF) produced significantly more MST with a larger number of different turning subtypes vs. controls or PD on medication (PD-ON). In 90-degree tasks, controls significantly increased their proportion of Step-turns while DT (pâ€¯<â€¯.001), an adaptation not observed in PD-ON or PD-OFF.
  Conclusions
  PD turning impairments may stem from an inability to select a unified turning strategy and to adapt to the turning environment, which may be exacerbated in PD-OFF. Video-analysis may prove beneficial in predicting a clinical course for PD patients by revealing features of turning dysfunction.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait,Video Recording,,Video camera,,j.jns.2018.11.028,Research Article,

However, no work has analyzed in detail the importance of the different phonemes in the automatic detection of PD from the speech. This work proposes new approaches for this detection by using new classification schemes that allow to compare independently the different phonetic units of patients and controls employed during several speech tasks. Three different parkinsonian corpora were used allowing cross-validation and cross-corpora trials. The results of cross-validation trials (k-folds) provided accuracies between 81% and 94%, with AUC between 0.87 and 0.97 depending on the corpus, while cross-corpora trials yielded accuracies between 66% and 76% with AUC between 0.76 and 0.87. These results suggest that PD affects to the articulatory sequence as a whole, influencing more clearly phonetic units requiring a higher narrowing of the vocal tract. Additionally, text-dependent utterances are considered as the recommended speech task for the detection of PD in this type of schemes as these allow to compare more precisely the phonetic units of patients and controls. Lastly, this work discusses the existence of a glass ceiling in the accuracy of the systems for the automatic detection of PD using speech, concluding that this is below 95% for most of the cases.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.bspc.2018.10.020,Research Article,

As approximately 90% percent of PD patients exhibit some form of vocal disorders in the earlier stages of the disease, the recent PD telediagnosis studies focus on the detection of the vocal impairments from sustained vowel phonations or running speech of the subjects. In these studies, various speech signal processing algorithms have been used to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment, and the calculated features were fed to learning algorithms to construct reliable decision support systems. In this study, we apply, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to the voice signals of PD patients for feature extraction, which has higher frequency resolution than the classical discrete wavelet transform. We compare the effectiveness of TQWT with the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods used in diagnosis of PD from vocal disorders. For this purpose, we have collected the voice recordings of 252 subjects in the context of this study and extracted multiple feature subsets from the voice recordings. The feature subsets are fed to multiple classifiers and the predictions of the classifiers are combined with ensemble learning approaches. The results show that TQWT performs better or comparable to the state-of-the-art speech signal processing techniques used in PD classification. We also find that Mel-frequency cepstral and the tunable-Q wavelet coefficients, which give the highest accuracies, contain complementary information in PD classification problem resulting in an improved system when combined using a filter feature selection technique.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.asoc.2018.10.022,Research Article,

  Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders that affect neurons in the brain resulting in a debilitating condition and progressive degeneration of nerve cells. These diseases involve different aspects among which speech impairment. Vocal signal analysis is used to evaluate this impairment and to discriminate normal from pathological voices.
  Materials and methods
  In this paper, two methods of vocal signal analysis have been proposed to evaluate an anomalous condition in human speech, known as dysarthria, useful to compare pathological and healthy voices. Parkinson and Multiple Sclerosis disease have been considered and patients affected by both pathologies have been enrolled. The methods have been tested on 153 voice signals belonging to: 39 healthy subjects (HS), 60 patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and 54 patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Acoustic (F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR) and vowel metric (tVSA, qVSA, FCR) features have been extracted.
  Results
  The results report significant differences in almost all of these features in pathological and healthy voices by performing statistical tests. F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR, tVSA and FCR are statistically significant features thus they can be used as indicators in the diagnosis of dysarthria-related diseases such as in PD and MS. The results suggest that the applied methodologies are efficient and useful in characterizing the different behavior of vocal signal in healthy and pathological subjects. Consequently, they could be a valid support for physicians in disease evaluation and progression monitoring.
  Conclusions
  The contribution aims to evaluate, support and diagnose the comorbidity in pathological patients verifying the co-occurrence of speech and neurological disorders in the same individual. The proposed solution is studied and implemented to be efficient and low cost following the model of precision medicine to customize clinical practice in disease diagnosis and treatment.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,j.ijmedinf.2018.11.008,Research Article,
The transition between turning and sitting in patients with Parkinson's disease: A wearable device detects an unexpected sequence of events,"Weiss, Aner; Herman, Talia; Mirelman, Anat; Shiratzky, Shirley Shema; Giladi, Nir; Barnes, Lisa L.; Bennett, David A.; Buchman, Aron S.; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.",2019,Gait & Posture,"Parkinson's disease, Accelerometer, Cognitive function, Wearables, Body-fixed sensor","Background
  When older adults turn to sit, about 80% of the subjects complete the turn before starting to sit i.e., a distinct-strategy, while in about 20%, part of the turning and sitting take place concurrently, i.e., an overlapping-strategy. A prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlap interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) are related to worse motor symptoms and poorer cognition. In the present study, we evaluated what strategy is employed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) when they transition from turning to sitting.
  Methods
  96 participants with PD performed turn to sit as part of the Timed Up and Go test, both with and without medications, while wearing a body-fixed sensor. We quantified the turn-to-sit transition and determined which strategy (distinct or overlapping) was employed. We then stratified the cases and used regression models adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight to examine the associations of the D-interval or O-interval with parkinsonian features and cognition.
  Results
  Most patients (66%) employed the overlapping-strategy, both off and on anti-parkinsonian medications. Longer O-intervals were associated with longer duration of PD, more severe PD motor symptoms, a higher postural-instability-gait-disturbance (PIGD) score, and worse Freezing of gait. Longer D-intervals were not associated with disease duration or PD motor symptoms. Neither the D- nor O-intervals were related to cognitive function. Individuals who employed the overlapping-strategy had more severe postural instability (i.e., higher PIGD scores), as compared to those who used the distinct-strategy.
  Significance
  In contrast to older adults without PD, most patients with PD utilize the overlapping strategy. Poorer postural and gait control are associated with the strategy choice and with the duration of concurrent performance of turning and sitting. Additional work is needed to further explicate the mechanisms underlying these strategies and their clinical implications.",,,Diagnosis,"Gait,Balance",Wearable,,"Accelerometer,Gyroscope",100,j.gaitpost.2018.10.018,Research Article,

Gait signal is one of the best features to characterize and detect movement disorders caused by a malfunction in parts of the brain and nervous system of the patients with PD. Various classification approaches using spatiotemporal gait variables have been presented earlier to classify Parkinson's gait. In this study we propose a novel method for gait pattern classification between patients with PD and healthy controls, based upon phase space reconstruction (PSR), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and neural networks. First, vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs) at specific positions of human feet are captured and then phase space is reconstructed. The properties associated with the gait system dynamics are preserved in the reconstructed phase space. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been used. These measured parameters demonstrate significant difference in gait dynamics between the two groups and have been utilized to form a reference variable set. Second, reference variables are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and the third IMFs are extracted and served as gait features. Third, neural networks are then used as the classifier to distinguish between patients with PD and healthy controls based on the difference of gait dynamics preserved in the gait features between the two groups. Finally, experiments are carried out on 93 PD patients and 73 healthy subjects to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using 2-fold, 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation styles, the correct classification rates are reported to be 91.46%, 96.99% and 98.80%, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic and non-invasive classification between patients with PD and healthy subjects.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,Force sensor,uk,j.neunet.2018.12.012,Research Article,

  Depression is a predominant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often under recognised and undertreated. To improve identification of depression in PD it is imperative to examine objective brain-related markers. The present study addresses this gap by using electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the processing of emotionally valanced words in PD.
  Methods
  Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed an affective priming task while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Prime and target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a short 250â€¯ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Depression was measured using an established rating scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether event-related potentials (ERP) varied as a function of depression scores.
  Results
  Key ERP findings reveal reduced responses in parietal midline P300, N400 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) difference waves between congruent and incongruent neutral targets in patients with higher depression scores.
  Limitations
  Comparisons of ERPs were limited by insufficient classification of participants with and without clinical depression. A majority of PD patients who had high depression scores were excluded from the analysis as they were receiving antidepressant and/or anxiolytic medications which could interfere with ERP sensitivity.
  Conclusions
  The present study suggests that the Pz-P300, N400 and LPP are ERP markers relates to emotional dysfunction in PD. These findings thus advance current knowledge regarding the neurophysiological markers of a common neuropsychiatric deficit in PD.",,,Diagnosis,Depression,BioPotential,,EEG,,j.jad.2018.11.094,Research Article,

  Cortical dysfunctioning significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).
  Objective
  We aimed at testing whether an acute levodopa administration has measurable and specific cortical effects possibly related to striatal dopaminergic deficit.
  Methods
  In thirteen PD patients, we measured the electroencephalographic responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS/EEG) of the supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobule (nâ€¯=â€¯8) before and after an acute intake of levodopa. We also performed a single-photon emission computed tomography and [123I]N-Ï‰-fluoropropyl-2Î²-carbomethoxy-3Î²-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane to identify the more affected and the less affected brain side in each patient, according to the dopaminergic innervation loss of the putamen. Cortical excitability changes before and after an acute intake of levodopa were computed and compared between the more and the less affected brain side at the single-patient as well as at the group level.
  Results
  We found that levodopa intake induces a significant increase (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.01) of cortical excitability nearby the supplementary motor area in the more affected brain side, greater (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.025) than in the less affected brain side. Notably, cortical excitability changes nearby the superior parietal lobule were not statistically significant.
  Conclusions
  These results strengthen the idea that dysfunction of specific cortico-subcortical circuits may contribute to pathophysiology of PD symptoms.

Proposed method took advantage of the prominent aspects of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and filter-based feature selection models. Relief and Fisher Score were selected as filter-based methods for their effective performance in handling noisy data while VAE was used as a feature extractor due to the capability of preserving the regular latent space properties during the feature generation. In order to assess the effectiveness of the devised method, multi-kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier were trained with obtained deep feature representations. The combination of deep Relief features and SVM with multiple kernels distinguished Pd individuals from healthy subjects with an accuracy of 0.916 with 0.772 Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) rates using only 30 features.

In this study, a classification method for discriminating PD patients from healthy individuals was proposed in which using several feature sets extracted from vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) data and incorporating a decision tree classifier, higher classification performance was obtained compared with other existing methods. The feature sets were extracted for time, frequency and time-frequency domains by considering both local and global attributes of dynamic characteristics of human walking. The obtained results showed that considering features from different domains (time, frequency and time-frequency) enhanced classification performance in a large extent.

(2013) and Stern (1993). In recent years, machine learning-based speech data analysis has been shown to be effective for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) and automatically assessing rehabilitative speech treatment in PD Sakar et al. (2013), Tsanas et al. (2012) and Little et al. (2009). Machine learning includes feature learning and sample learning. Deep learning (deep feature learning) can generate high-level and high-quality features through deep feature transformation, improving classification accuracy. For reasons such as data collection, some samples have low quality for classification. Therefore, sample learning is necessary. Sample selection removes useless samples; therefore, deep sample learning is better, since it can generate high-level and high-quality samples through deep sample transformation. However, there are no public studies about deep sample learning. To solve the problem above, a deep dual-side learning ensemble model is designed in this paper. In this model, a deep sample learning algorithm is designed and combined with a deep network (deep feature learning), thereby realizing the deep dual-side learning of PD speech data. First, an embedded stack group sparse autoencoder is designed in this paper to conduct deep feature learning to acquire new high-level deep feature data. Second, the deep features are fused with original speech features by L1 regularization feature selection methods, thereby constructing hybrid feature data. Third, an iterative mean clustering algorithm (IMC) was designed, thereby constructing a deep sample learning algorithm and conducting deep sample transformation. After that step, hierarchical sample spaces are constructed based on a deep sample learning algorithm, and the classification models are constructed on the sample spaces. Finally, the weighted fusion mechanism is designed to merge the classification models into a classification ensemble model, thereby fusing the deep feature learning algorithm and the deep sample learning algorithm together. The ensemble model is called the deep dual-side learning ensemble model. At the end of this paper, two representative speech datasets of PD were used for validation. The experimental results show that the main innovation part of the algorithm is effective.

Investigating voice as a biomarker: Deep phenotyping methods for early detection of Parkinson's disease,"Tracy JM,ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Â“zkanca Y,Atkins DC,Hosseini Ghomi R",2020,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,"Parkinson's disease, Deep phenotype, Feature selection, Voice technology, Audio features, Voice biomarkers","Voice technology has grown tremendously in recent years and using voice as a biomarker has also been gaining evidence. We demonstrate the potential of voice in serving as a deep phenotype for Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, by presenting methodology for voice signal processing for clinical analysis. Detection of PD symptoms typically requires an exam by a Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia specialist and can be hard to access and inconsistent in findings. A vocal digital biomarker could supplement the cumbersome existing manual exam by detecting and quantifying symptoms to guide treatment. Specifically, vocal biomarkers of PD are a potentially effective method of assessing symptoms and severity in daily life, which is the focus of the current research. We analyzed a database of PD patient and non-PD subjects containing voice recordings that were used to extract paralinguistic features, which served as inputs to machine learning models to predict PD severity. The results are presented here and the limitations are discussed given the nature of the recordings. We note that our methodology only advances biomarker research and is not cleared for clinical use. Specifically, we demonstrate that conventional machine learning models applied to voice signals can be used to differentiate participants with PD who exhibit little to no symptoms from healthy controls. This work highlights the potential of voice to be used for early detection of PD and indicates that voice may serve as a deep phenotype for PD, enabling precision medicine by improving the speed, accuracy, accessibility, and cost of PD management.",,Existing Dataset,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,j.jbi.2019.103362,Journal Article,

To test this hypothesis, clinical and resting-state electroencephalographic rhythms in age-, sex-, and education-matched PD patients (N = 136) and Alzheimer's disease patients (AD, N = 85), and healthy older participants (Nold, N = 65), were available from an international archive. Electroencephalographic sources were estimated by eLORETA software. The results are as follows: (1) compared to the Nold participants, the AD and PD patients showed higher widespread delta source activities (PD > AD) and lower posterior alpha source activities (AD > PD); (2) the PD patients with the most pronounced motor deficits exhibited very low alpha source activities in widespread cortical regions; (3) the PD patients with the strongest cognitive deficits showed higher alpha source activities in widespread cortical regions; and (4) compared to the PD patients without visual hallucinations, those with visual hallucinations were characterized by higher posterior alpha sources activities. These results suggest that in PD patients resting in quiet wakefulness, abnormalities in cortical neural synchronization at alpha frequencies are differently related to cognitive, motor, and visual hallucinations.

In PD, theta and beta brain rhythms are associated with cognitive and motor functions, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that PD patients with lower-limb abnormalities would exhibit abnormal theta and beta rhythms in the mid-frontal cortical region during lower-limb action. Methods This study included thirty-nine participants; 13 PD patients with FOG (PDFOG+), 13 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 13 demographically-matched controls. We recorded scalp electroencephalograms (EEG) during a lower-limb pedaling motor task, which required intentional initiation and stopping of a motor movement. Results FOG scores were correlated with disease severity and cognition. PDFOG+ patients pedaled with reduced speed and decreased acceleration compared to PDFOGÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™ patients and controls. PDFOG+ patients exhibited attenuated theta-band (4-8 Hz) power and increased beta-band (13-30 Hz) power at mid-frontal electrode Cz during pedaling. Frontal theta- and beta-band oscillations also correlated with motor and cognitive deficits. Conclusion Frontal theta and beta oscillations are predictors of lower-limb motor symptoms in PD and could be used to design neuromodulation for PD-related lower-limb abnormalities.

The voice-based detection method consists in applying feature subset selection and four different classifiers to voice recordings from five datasets (gender-based, balanced and unbalanced) derived from the largest public dataset for voice-based PD detection. One of the contributions is an improvement over previous works on voice-based PD detection over the same dataset, in terms of performance and complexity. The detection performance is characterized by 95.9% of accuracy, 98.35% of sensitivity, 91.06% of specificity, and 95.6% of precision in women; and 94.36% of accuracy, 100% of sensitivity, 97.1% of specificity, and 96.83% of precision in men. The number of features, fed to classifiers, ranges from 6 to 20. This work shows that different factors are associated with PD detection according to gender: high-frequency voice content is the most significant functional information to assist PD detection in women, while low-frequency content assists PD detection in men better.

Timely and effective detection of PD is a key step to medical intervention. Recently, computer aided methods for PD detection have gained lots of attention in artificial intelligence domain. Methods This paper proposed a novel ensemble learning model fusing Random Forest (RF) classifiers and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to differentiate PD patients from healthy controls (HC). Six different RF models were separately constructed to generate the corresponding class probability vectors which represent an individual's category predictions on 6 different handwritten exams, and the final prediction result for an individual was obtained through voting strategy of all RF models. Stratified k-fold cross validation was performed to split the exam datasets and evaluate the classification performances. Results Experimental results prove that our proposed ensemble model on six handwritten exams has achieved better classification performances than a single RF based method on a single handwritten exam. Our ensemble of RF model based on multiple handwritten exams has promising accuracy (89.4 %), specificity (93.7 %), sensitivity (84.5 %) and F1-score (87.7 %).

The motivation for this work lies in the objective quantification of motor affectations not covered by the MDS-UPDRS scale such as unsteady oscillations and velocity decrements during the motor exploration. Overall, 12 different bio-mechanical features were quantified based on measurements performed by inertial measurement units (IMUs). After a feature selection process, the selected bio-mechanical features were used as inputs for a fuzzy inference model that predicts the stage of development of the disease in each patient.

This method efficiently encodes EEG time series into features that can detect PD in a computationally fast manner amenable to real time applications. Methods We included a total of 41 PD patients and 41 demographically-matched controls from New Mexico and Iowa. Data for all participants from New Mexico (27 PD patients and 27 controls) were used to evaluate in-sample LEAPD performance, with extensive cross-validation. Participants from Iowa (14 PD patients and 14 controls) were used for out-of-sample tests. Our method utilized data from six EEG leads which were as little as 2 min long. Results For the in-sample dataset, LEAPD differentiated PD patients from controls with 85.3 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 0.1% diagnostic accuracy, 93.3 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 0.5% area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), 87.9 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 0.9% sensitivity, and 82.7 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 1.1% specificity, with multiple cross-validations.

The majority of people suffering from PD develop several voice impairments mainly related to what is known as dysarthric speech. Voice analysis can help in PD detection and in the evaluation of the dysarthria level of the patients. This study introduces time-frequency features to model discontinuities and abrupt changes that arise in the voice signal due to PD. The proposed method consists of four stages: time-frequency matrix (TFM) representation, TFM decomposition using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), feature extraction and classification. Statistical analyses show that the proposed time-frequency features significantly differentiate between PD patients and healthy speakers. Experiments with sustained vowel phonations and isolated words of the corpus PC-GITA are conducted. The proposed method achieved average classification accuracies of up to 92% in vowels, and 97% in words. There is an improvement in accuracy ranging from 10% to 40% compared to existing methods. Further, the developed models are evaluated upon an independent dataset. Results on this separate test set show accuracies ranging from 63% to 75% in vowels, and from 53% to 75% in isolated words.

The analysis of patients' fine motor control, particularly handwriting, is a powerful tool to support PD assessment. Over the years, various dynamic attributes of handwriting, such as pen pressure, stroke speed, in-air time, etc., which can be captured with the help of online handwriting acquisition tools, have been evaluated for the identification of PD. Motion events, and their associated spatio-temporal properties captured in online handwriting, enable effective classification of PD patients through the identification of unique sequential patterns. This paper proposes a novel classification model based on one-dimensional convolutions and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) to assess the potential of sequential information of handwriting in identifying Parkinsonian symptoms. One-dimensional convolutions are applied to raw sequences as well as derived features; the resulting sequences are then fed to BiGRU layers to achieve the final classification.

Data-driven gait analysis for diagnosis and severity rating of Parkinson's disease,"E B,D B,Elumalai VK,K U",2021,Medical Engineering & Physics,"Parkinsons disease (PD), H&Y scale, Spatiotemporal features, Supervised classifiers, Confusion matrix, Optimal features","Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most neurodegenerative disease, which results in gradual loss of movements. To diagnose PD in a clinical setting, clinicians generally use clinical manifestations like motor and non-motor symptoms and rate the severity based on unified Parkinsons disease rating scale (UPDRS). Such clinical assessment largely depends on the expertise and experience of the clinicians and it is subjective leading to variation in assessment between clinicians. As the gait of people with Parkinson's generally differs from gait of healthy age-matched adults, the assessment of gait abnormalities can lead to not only the diagnosis of PD but also the rating of severity level based on motor symptoms. Hence, in this paper, a data-driven gait classification framework using the supervised machine learning algorithms is presented. Using the publicly available gait datasets acquired using vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) sensors, we present a correlation based feature extraction technique for improved stage classification of PD. Significant biomarkers from spatiotemporal gait features are obtained based on the correlation, and the normal distribution of the gait dataset is assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Subsequently, four supervised machine learning algorithms, namely, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Ensemble classifier (EC) and Support vector machine (SVM) are used to rate the severity level of PD according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The performance of the classifiers, assessed using the confusion matrix and parallel coordinate plots, highlights that SVM can result in a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Moreover, with minimal gait feature set acquired based on the rank correlation, the proposed approach outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods that have used the same dataset for PD stage classification.",>30,Existing Dataset,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Pressure sensor,,j.medengphy.2021.03.005,Journal Article,

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals may faithfully represent the changes that occur during PD in the brain. But manual analysis of EEG signals is tedious, and time consuming as these signals are complex, non-linear, and non-stationary nature. Therefore EEG signals are required to decompose into multiple subbands (SBs) to get detailed and representative information from it. Experimental selection of basis function for the decomposition may cause system degradation due to information loss and an increased number of misclassification. To address this, an automated tunable Q wavelet transform (A-TQWT) is proposed for automatic decomposition. A-TQWT extracts representative SBs for analysis and provides better reconstruction for the synthesis of EEG signals by automatically selecting the tuning parameters. Five features are extracted from the SBs and classified different machine learning techniques.

Diagnosis and monitoring of the disease typically rely on the laborious examination of physical symptoms by medical experts, which is necessarily limited and may not detect the prodromal stages of the disease. New method We propose a lightweight ( 20 K parameters) deep learning model to classify resting-state EEG recorded from people with PD and healthy controls (HC). The proposed CRNN model consists of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with gated recurrent units (GRUs). The 1D CNN layers are designed to extract spatiotemporal features across EEG channels, which are subsequently supplied to the GRUs to discover temporal features pertinent to the classification. Results The CRNN model achieved 99.2% accuracy, 98.9% precision, and 99.4% recall in classifying PD from HC. Interrogating the model, we further demonstrate that the model is sensitive to dopaminergic medication effects and predominantly uses phase information in the EEG signals. Comparison with existing methods The CRNN model achieves superior performance compared to baseline machine learning methods and other recently proposed deep learning model. Conclusion The approach proposed in this study adequately extracts spatial and temporal features in multi-channel EEG signals that enable accurate differentiation between PD and HC.

This disease is difficult to diagnose and is one of the common diseases in the public. In this paper, we have proposed a novel data sampling method for the classification of Parkinson disease based on the acoustic features from the speech signals. In the proposed data sampling method, the one against all (OGA) has been used to divide the dataset into five equal parts. With applying the OGA to the PD dataset having two classes (healthy and Parkinson disease), the minority and majority classes have been obtained. First of all, for healthy class in the dataset (first case), five equal partitions have been composed and then for PD class in the dataset (second case), five equal partitions have been composed. To classify the these all data partitions, we have used three different classifiers including the weighted k-NN (nearest neighbor), Logistic Regression (LR), and support vector machine with medium Gaussian kernel function. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid models (the combination of classifiers and OGA based data sampling), the classification accuracy, the confusion matrix, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) have been used. While the LR, SVM with Gaussian, and weighted k-NN classifiers achieved the classification accuracies of 77.50%, 83.80%, and 82.10% in the classification of PD with the acoustic features, the combinations of classifiers and OGA based data sampling (first case) obtained the 79.04%, 87.36%, and 88.48% using the LR, SVM with Gaussian, and weighted k-NN classifiers, respectively.

More than a dozen popular classifiers were considered in the study. Additionally, for each of the tested classifiers, a set of features of voice samples were selected, for which a given classifier showed the highest classification efficiency. The Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), which belongs to the wrapper methods, was used for feature selection. The ensemble of classifiers was then tested in two cases, with all features considered and including only those indicated by the SBS method. The obtained results were compared with each other. All experiments were performed on a publicly available database containing voice samples of Parkinson's patients and healthy patients.

A Hybrid Approach for Parkinson's Disease diagnosis with Resonance and Time-Frequency based features from Speech signals,"Goyal J,Khandnor P,Aseri TC",2021,Expert Systems with Applications,"Parkinson's disease, Voice disorder, Resonance based components, RSSD, PSD, CNN, Diversity","Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain. As PD progresses, there arises a problem of maintaining coordination between brain and different parts of the body. Subjects have the problem of performing daily activities. Its early diagnosis is important to improve the quality of life of Parkinson's patients. Most of Parkinson's patients are likely to have voice disorders in the early stages. Therefore, the analysis of voice recordings with machine learning-based models can improve the diagnosis process. Voice signals are non-linear, non-stationary signals which exhibit oscillatory behavior. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed to extract features from resonance-based and time-frequency based information. A combination of Resonance based Sparse Signal Decomposition (RSSD) + Time-Frequency (T-F) algorithm is proposed. Two datasets are collected for the study. The first dataset D1 is a public dataset consisting of 16 PD + 21 Healthy Controls (HC) and the second dataset D2 is collected from 20 HC to explore the effect of diversity in the diagnosis process. To explore the potential of deep learning techniques in diagnosing speech impairments in PD patients, the potential of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is also explored. To evaluate the method, we conducted several experiments with state-of-the-art feature extraction and classification techniques. The proposed hybrid approach distinguished PD and HC with a validation accuracy of 99.37%. We have also explored the effect of diversity in the data collection process and it is observed that diversity in the socio-cultural group plays very important role to put the system in the clinical practice.",>30,Existing Dataset,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,j.eswa.2021.115283,Journal Article,

Motor disorders mainly characterize PD, and consequently, a variety of data sets are recorded from the motor system. These data sets consist of either physical behaviors of patients or neuroimaging data captured from their brains. However, the disease mostly begins years before the motor symptoms. Consequently, non-motor symptoms have been studied more in the last decade. Since about 90% of patients experience vocal disorders in the early stages, these symptoms can be more useful for diagnosing the disease. We will review data sets developed for PD diagnosis and some machine learning classification models applied to these data sets. We will offer some models to accurately predict PD according to vocal symptoms characteristics provided in the UCI Machine Learning database, which suffers a low number of samples compared to features and being imbalanced. The results of comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed classic classification models can outperform various Deep learning methods that have been previously used in the literature.

Fox Insight is an ongoing prospective clinical research study that enables individuals to participate in clinical research from their own homes by completing online questionnaires. To date, over 45,000 participants with and without PD have enrolled. We sought to validate self-reported PD diagnosis in the Fox Insight cohort, assess the validity of other self-reported health information, and evaluate the willingness of participants to participate in video-based research studies. Methods Individuals with and without self-reported PD enrolled in Fox Insight were invited to participate in this virtual research study. Participants completed online questionnaires and two virtual visits, during which we conducted standard cognitive and motor assessments. A Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia expert determined the most likely diagnosis, which was compared to self-reported diagnosis. Results A total of 203 participants from 40 U.S. states, 159 with remote clinician-determined PD and 44 without, completed the study (59% male, mean (SD) age 65.7 (9.8)). Level of agreement between self-reported PD diagnosis in Fox Insight and clinician-determined diagnosis was very good ((kappa = 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.94). Overall, 97.9% of participants were satisfied with the study, 98.5% were willing to participate in a future observational study with virtual visits, and 76.1% were willing to participate in an interventional trial with virtual visits.

Analysis of the stance phase of the gait cycle in Parkinson's disease and its potency for Parkinson's disease discrimination,Farashi S,2021,Journal of Biomechanics,"Parkinson's disease, Stance phase, Vertical ground reaction force, Classification","In this study, using vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) data and focusing on the stance phase of the gait cycle, the effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) on gait was investigated. The used dataset consisted of 93 PD and 72 healthy individuals. Multiple comparisons correction ANOVA test and student t-test were used for statistical analyses. Results showed that a longer stance duration with a larger VGRF peak value (p < 0.05) was observed for PD patients during the stance phase. In addition, the VGRF peak value was delayed and blunted in PD cases compared with healthy individuals. These results indicated more time and effort for PD patients for posture stabilization during the stance phase. The time delay for different locations of the foot sole to contact the ground during the stance phase indicated that PD patients might use a different strategy for maintaining their body stability compared with healthy individuals. Although the VGRF time-domain pattern during the stance phase in PD was similar to healthy conditions, its local characteristics like duration and peak value differed significantly. The classification analysis based on the VGRF time-domain extracted features during the stance phase obtained PD recognition with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 90.82%, 88.63% and 82.56%, respectively.",>30,Existing Dataset,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Force sensor,100Hz,j.jbiomech.2021.110818,Journal Article,

Such a clinical evaluation highly depends on the expertise and experience of the clinicians and results in variation in assessment among clinicians. Hence, to assist the clinicians to diagnose the PD and rate the severity level, we present a gait classification based decision support system using multi-class support vector machine (MCSVM). As the gait alterations are the initial manifestations of PD, we utilize the publicly available vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) dataset and perform the kinematic analysis to extract the spatiotemporal features. To identify the prominent gait biomarkers, this work utilizes a correlation based feature selection approach and employs multi-regression approach to normalize the gait time series data. Moreover, transforming the multi-class classification problem into multiple binary classification problem using one-versus-one (OVO) strategy, the proposed PD severity rating framework tests the performance of four SVM kernel functions for three different walking tests. Experimental results highlight that the quadratic SVM classifier offers an average accuracy of 98.65% and outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods that utilized gait dataset for PD diagnosis.",>30,Existing Dataset,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Force sensor,100Hz,j.asoc.2021.107939,Journal Article,
Parkinson's detection based on combined CNN and LSTM using enhanced speech signals with Variational mode decomposition,"Er MB,Isik E,Isik I",2021,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,"Parkinson's disease, Long short-term memory, Variational Mode Decomposition, Convolutional Neural Network","Parkinson's disease (PD) can cause many non-motor and motor symptoms such as speech and smell. One of the difficulties that Parkinson's patients can experience is a change in speech or speaking difficulties. Therefore, the right diagnosis in the early period is important in reducing the possible effects of speech disorders caused by the disease. Speech signal of Parkinson patients shows major differences compared to normal people. In this study, a new approach based on pre-trained deep networks and Long short-term memory (LSTM) by using mel-spectrograms obtained from denoised speech signals with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) for detecting PD from speech sounds is proposed. The proposed model consists of four steps. In the first step, the noise is removed by applying VMD to the signals. In the second step, mel-spectrograms are extracted from the enhanced sound signals with VMD. In the third step, pre-trained deep networks are preferred to extract deep features from the mel-spectrograms. For this purpose, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 models are used as pre-trained deep network architecture. In the last step, the classification process is occurred by giving these features as input to the LSTM model, which is designed to define sequential information from the extracted features. Experiments are performed with the PC-GITA dataset, which consists of two classes and is widely used in the literature. The results obtained from the proposed method are compared with the latest methods in the literature, it is seen that it has a better performance in terms of classification performance.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,j.bspc.2021.103006,Journal Article,

V",2021,Applied Soft Computing,"Parkinson's disease, LSTM, VGRF Sensor, H & Y scale, Adam optimizer, L2 regularization","Deep learning has a huge potential in healthcare for uncovering the hidden patterns from large volume of clinical data to diagnose different diseases. This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture based long short term memory (LSTM) network for severity rating of Parkinson's disease (PD) using gait pattern. Unlike machine learning (ML) algorithms, the LSTM network avoids the need for hand crafted features and learns the long-term temporal dependencies in the gait cycle for robust diagnosis of PD. The primary advantage of the LSTM network is that it solves the vanishing gradient problem by introducing the memory blocks in place of self-connected hidden units, thereby deciding when to learn new information. Three distinct gait datasets containing vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) recordings for different walking scenarios are used for training the LSTM network. To avoid data overfitting, the proposed approach utilizes dropout and L2 regularization techniques. For solving the cost function, Adam, a stochastic gradient-based optimizer, is employed and the severity of PD is categorized based on unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The experimental results reveal that Adam optimized LSTM network can effectively learn the gait kinematic features and offer an average accuracy of 98.6% for binary classification and 96.6% for multi-class classification, with an accuracy improvement of 3.4% in comparison with the related techniques.",>30,Existing Dataset,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Force sensor,,j.asoc.2021.107463,Journal Article,

PD can be clinically misdiagnosed in early stages because motor features become evident long after the onset of neuronal loss. Therefore, different remote monitoring tests were studied by the scholars for early detection. It has shown that people with PD exhibit gait variability with respect to healthy subjects. In this study, gait signals of PD patients were analyzed to detect severity of PD. Gait signals were converted to fuzzy recurrence plots and deep features were extracted. Machine learning techniques were applied to perform several classification experiments. Binary classifications to discriminate PD patients and multiclass classifications to predict the disease severity based on gender were conducted.

The main features, including Jitter and Shimmer perturbations, are extracted. To find an optimal pair under both noisy and noiseless circumstance, we use the Relief feature selection strategy. This research shows that the Jitter feature for men and women with Parkinson's is 21 and 33.4, respectively. While the Shimmer feature is 0.1 and 0.06. In addition, by using these two features alone, we reach a correct diagnosis rate of 79% and 81% for noisy and noiseless states, respectively. The PD effects on the speech features can be accurately identified.

We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56â€“64.66 and 40.19â€“72.50 msecs, respectively.

Hierarchical Boosting Dual-Stage Feature Reduction Ensemble Model for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Speech Data,"Yang, Mingyao; Ma, Jie; Wang, Pin; Huang, Zhiyong; Li, Yongming; Liu, He; Hameed, Zeeshan",2021,Diagnostics,"Parkinsonâ€™s disease,hierarchy space instance learning mechanism,dual-stage feature reduction pair,ensemble learning","As a neurodegenerative disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is hard to identify at the early stage, while using speech data to build a machine learning diagnosis model has proved effective in its early diagnosis. However, speech data show high degrees of redundancy, repetition, and unnecessary noise, which influence the accuracy of diagnosis results. Although feature reduction (FR) could alleviate this issue, the traditional FR is one-sided (traditional feature extraction could construct high-quality features without feature preference, while traditional feature selection could achieve feature preference but could not construct high-quality features). To address this issue, the Hierarchical Boosting Dual-Stage Feature Reduction Ensemble Model (HBD-SFREM) is proposed in this paper. The major contributions of HBD-SFREM are as follows: (1) The instance space of the deep hierarchy is built by an iterative deep extraction mechanism. (2) The manifold features extraction method embeds the nearest neighbor feature preference method to form the dual-stage feature reduction pair. (3) The dual-stage feature reduction pair is iteratively performed by the AdaBoost mechanism to obtain instances features with higher quality, thus achieving a substantial improvement in model recognition accuracy. (4) The deep hierarchy instance space is integrated into the original instance space to improve the generalization of the algorithm. Three PD speech datasets and a self-collected dataset are used to test HBD-SFREM in this paper. Compared with other FR algorithms and deep learning algorithms, the accuracy of HBD-SFREM in PD speech recognition is improved significantly and would not be affected by a small sample dataset. Thus, HBD-SFREM could give a reference for other related studies.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,diagnostics11122312,research-article,
A mobile-assisted voice condition analysis system for Parkinsonâ€™s disease: assessment of usability conditions,"CarrÃ³n, Javier; Campos-Roca, Yolanda; Madruga, Mario; PÃ©rez, Carlos J.",2021,BioMedical Engineering OnLine,"Acoustic features,Machine learning,mPower database,Parkinsonâ€™s disease,Speech processing,Voice condition analysis system","Automatic voice condition analysis systems to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) are generally based on speech data recorded under acoustically controlled conditions and professional supervision. The performance of these approaches in a free-living scenario is unknown. The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of uncontrolled conditions (realistic acoustic environment and lack of supervision) on the performance of automatic PD detection systems based on speech. A mobile-assisted voice condition analysis system is proposed to aid in the detection of PD using speech. The system is based on a serverâ€“client architecture. In the server, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms are designed and implemented to discriminate subjects with PD from healthy ones. The Android app allows patients to submit phonations and physicians to check the complete record of every patient. Six different machine learning classifiers are applied to compare their performance on two different speech databases. One of them is an in-house database (UEX database), collected under professional supervision by using the same Android-based smartphone in the same room, whereas the other one is an age, sex and health-status balanced subset of mPower study for PD, which provides real-world data. By applying identical methodology, single-database experiments have been performed on each database, and also cross-database tests. Cross-validation has been applied to assess generalization performance and hypothesis tests have been used to report statistically significant differences. In the single-database experiments, a best accuracy rate of 0.92 (AUC = 0.98) has been obtained on UEX database, while a considerably lower best accuracy rate of 0.71 (AUC = 0.76) has been achieved using the mPower-based database. The cross-database tests provided very degraded accuracy metrics. The results clearly show the potential of the proposed system as an aid for general practitioners to conduct triage or an additional tool for neurologists to perform diagnosis. However, due to the performance degradation observed using data from mPower study, semi-controlled conditions are encouraged, i.e., voices recorded at home by the patients themselves following a strict recording protocol and control of the information about patients by the medical doctor at charge.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,Microphone,,s12938-021-00951-y,research-article,
"A Markerless 2D Video, Facial Feature Recognitionâ€“Based, Artificial Intelligence Model to Assist With Screening for Parkinson Disease: Development and Usability Study",,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Parkinson disease,facial features,artificial intelligence,diagnosis","Masked face is a characteristic clinical manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD), but subjective evaluations from different clinicians often show low consistency owing to a lack of accurate detection technology. Hence, it is of great significance to develop methods to make monitoring easier and more accessible. The study aimed to develop a markerless 2D video, facial feature recognitionâ€“based, artificial intelligence (AI) model to assess facial features of PD patients and investigate how AI could help neurologists improve the performance of early PD diagnosis. We collected 140 videos of facial expressions from 70 PD patients and 70 matched controls from 3 hospitals using a single 2D video camera. We developed and tested an AI model that performs masked face recognition of PD patients based on the acquisition and evaluation of facial features including geometric and texture features. Random forest, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor were used to train the model. The diagnostic performance of the AI model was compared with that of 5 neurologists. The experimental results showed that our AI models can achieve feasible and effective facial feature recognition ability to assist with PD diagnosis. The accuracy of PD diagnosis can reach 83% using geometric features. And with the model trained by random forest, the accuracy of texture features is up to 86%. When these 2 features are combined, an F1 value of 88% can be reached, where the random forest algorithm is used. Further, the facial features of patients with PD were not associated with the motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD. PD patients commonly exhibit masked facial features. Videos of a facial feature recognitionâ€“based AI model can provide a valuable tool to assist with PD diagnosis and the potential of realizing remote monitoring of the patientâ€™s condition, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,Diagnosis,Facial features,Video Recording,,Video,,29554,research-article,

Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary effectiveness of a novel wearable vibrotactile stimulation device on resting tremor in individuals with PD. Methods: Using a randomized cross-over design, subjects received two different vibrotactile stimulation paradigms (high amplitude patterned and low amplitude continuous) on two separate laboratory visits. On each visit, resting tremor was video recorded for 10 min at baseline and while the vibrotactile stimulation was applied. Tremor severity was scored by a blinded clinician. Results: Both vibration paradigms were well safe and well tolerated and resulted in a reduction in resting tremor severity with a moderate effect size ( n = 44, p < 0.001, r = 0.37â€“0.54). There was no significant difference between the two vibration paradigms ( p = 0.14). Conclusion: Short durations of vibrotactile stimulation delivered via wearable devices were safe and well tolerated and may attenuate resting tremor severity in individuals with PD.

We aimed to compare patterns of speech disorder in early-onset PD (EOPD) and late-onset PD (LOPD) in drug-naive patients at early stages of disease. Speech samples were acquired from a total of 96 participants, including two subgroups of 24 de-novo PD patients and two subgroups of 24 age- and sex-matched young and old healthy controls. The EOPD group included patients with age at onset below 51 (mean 42.6, standard deviation 6.1) years and LOPD group patients with age at onset above 69 (mean 73.9, standard deviation 3.0) years. Quantitative acoustic vocal assessment of 10 unique speech dimensions related to respiration, phonation, articulation, prosody, and speech timing was performed. Despite similar perceptual dysarthria severity in both PD subgroups, EOPD showed weaker inspirations ( p â€‰=â€‰0.03), while LOPD was characterized by decreased voice quality ( p â€‰=â€‰0.02) and imprecise consonant articulation ( p â€‰=â€‰0.03). In addition, age-independent occurrence of monopitch ( p â€‰<â€‰0.001), monoloudness ( p â€‰=â€‰0.008), and articulatory decay ( p â€‰=â€‰0.04) was observed in both PD subgroups. The worsening of consonant articulation was correlated with the severity of axial gait symptoms ( r â€‰=â€‰0.38, p â€‰=â€‰0.008). Speech abnormalities in EOPD and LOPD share common features but also show phenotype-specific characteristics, likely reflecting the influence of aging on the process of neurodegeneration.

Detecting Parkinson Disease Using a Web-Based Speech Task: Observational Study,,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Parkinsonâ€™s disease,speech analysis,improving access and equity in health care,mobile phone","Access to neurological care for Parkinson disease (PD) is a rare privilege for millions of people worldwide, especially in resource-limited countries. In 2013, there were just 1200 neurologists in India for a population of 1.3 billion people; in Africa, the average population per neurologist exceeds 3.3 million people. In contrast, 60,000 people receive a diagnosis of PD every year in the United States alone, and similar patterns of rising PD casesâ€”fueled mostly by environmental pollution and an aging populationâ€”can be seen worldwide. The current projection of more than 12 million patients with PD worldwide by 2040 is only part of the picture given that more than 20% of patients with PD remain undiagnosed. Timely diagnosis and frequent assessment are key to ensure timely and appropriate medical intervention, thus improving the quality of life of patients with PD. In this paper, we propose a web-based framework that can help anyone anywhere around the world record a short speech task and analyze the recorded data to screen for PD. We collected data from 726 unique participants (PD: 262/726, 36.1% were women; non-PD: 464/726, 63.9% were women; average age 61 years) from all over the United States and beyond. A small portion of the data (approximately 54/726, 7.4%) was collected in a laboratory setting to compare the performance of the models trained with noisy home environment data against high-quality laboratory-environment data. The participants were instructed to utter a popular pangram containing all the letters in the English alphabet, â€œthe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.â€ We extracted both standard acoustic features (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and jitter and shimmer variants) and deep learningâ€“based embedding features from the speech data. Using these features, we trained several machine learning algorithms. We also applied model interpretation techniques such as Shapley additive explanations to ascertain the importance of each feature in determining the modelâ€™s output. We achieved an area under the curve of 0.753 for determining the presence of self-reported PD by modeling the standard acoustic features through the XGBoostâ€”a gradient-boosted decision tree model. Further analysis revealed that the widely used mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features and a subset of previously validated dysphonia features designed for detecting PD from a verbal phonation task (pronouncing â€œahhâ€) influence the modelâ€™s decision the most. Our model performed equally well on data collected in a controlled laboratory environment and in the wild across different gender and age groups. Using this tool, we can collect data from almost anyone anywhere with an audio-enabled device and help the participants screen for PD remotely, contributing to equity and access in neurological care.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,Web based recording,Microphone,,26305,research-article,

This article explores the hypothesis that the observed average performances of automatic processing find their cause in the design of the corpora. To this aim, we first discuss and refine the concept of sleepiness related to the ground-truth labels. Second, we present an in-depth study of four corpora, bringing to light the methodological choices that have been made and the underlying biases they may have induced.

Despite the growing influence of mobile technology and telemedicine, there is a paucity of studies examining the role of home videos in the diagnosis of Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias. To characterize the clinical value of patient home videos in a Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias practice. We performed a retrospective review from our video database over the past 10 years and identified 20 encounters where an in-person, clinic evaluation and studio video were supplemented by a home video. We reviewed these encounters to determine if the home video added additional value to the clinic video. The home videos were screened by 3 Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias attendings and 3 Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias fellows to assess for quality and to determine whether or not the patient phenomenology could accurately be identified. Of the 20 videos identified, 10 (50%) were determined to be of additional clinical value. In 62.4% of evaluations Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias attendings and fellows were able to identify phenomenology from the home videos consistent with the final diagnosis. Videos rated as â€œpoorâ€ quality had significantly lower odds of leading to a correct phenomenology (odd ratio: 0.07, 95% confidence interval [0.01â€“0.72]) than those rated as â€œexcellentâ€ quality.

The index obtained from texture analysis on PET images is related to pathological change that the neuronal loss of the nigrostriatal tract is heterogeneous according to the disease state. The aim of this study is to evaluate various heterogeneity indices of F-18 FP-CIT PET images in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and to access the diagnostic accuracy of the indices using machine learning (ML). This retrospective study included F-18 FP-CIT PET images of 31 PD and 31 age-matched health controls (HC). The volume of interest was delineated according to iso-contour lines around standardized uptake value (SUV) 3.0â€Šg/ml for each region of the striatum by PMod 3.603. One hundred eight heterogeneity indices were calculated using CGITA to find indices from which the PD and HC were classified using statistical significance. PD group was classified by constructing a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional phase space quantifier using these heterogeneity indices. We used 71 heterogeneity indices to classify PD from HC using ML for dimensional reduction. The heterogeneity indices for classifying PD from HC were size-zone variability, contrast, inverse difference-moment, and homogeneity in the order of low P value. Three-dimensional quantifiers composed of normalized-contrast, code-similarity, and contrast were more clearly classified than 2-dimensional ones. After 71-dimensional reduction using PCA, classification was possible by logistic regression with 91.3% accuracy. The 2 groups were classified with an accuracy of 85.5% using the support vector machine and 88.4% using the random forest. The classification accuracy using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting was 95.7%, and feature importance was highest in order of SUV bias-corrected kurtosis, size-zone-variability, intensity-variability, and high-intensity-zone-variability. It was confirmed that PD patients is more clearly classified than the conventional 2-dimensional quantifier by introducing a 3-dimensional phase space quantifier. We observed that ML can be used to classify the 2 groups in an easy and explanatory manner. For the discrimination of the disease, 24 heterogeneity indices were found to be statistically useful, and the major cut-off values of 3 heterogeneity indices were size-zone variability (1906.44), intensity variability (129.21), and high intensity zone emphasis (800.29).",>30,,Diagnosis,,Other,,,,md.0000000000026961,research-article,

Objectives: This study aims to investigate self-reported changes in motor and non-motor aspects during social distancing in people with PD living in Brazil and to investigate the factors that might explain these changes. Methods: In this multicenter cross-sectional trial, 478 people with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD (mean age = 67, SD = 9.5; 167 female) were recruited from 14 centers distributed throughout the five geographical regions of Brazil. The evaluators from each center applied a questionnaire by telephone, which included questions (previous and current period of social distancing) about the motor and non-motor experiences of daily living, quality of life, daily routine, and physical activity volume. Results: Self-reported clinical worsening in non-motor and motor aspects of daily life experiences (Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society-Unified PD Rating Scaleâ€”parts IB and IIâ€”emotional and mental health, and fear of falling) and in the quality of life was observed. Only 31% of the participants reported a guided home-based physical activity with distance supervision. Perceived changes in the quality of life, freezing of gait, decreased physical activity volume, daily routine, and fear of falling explained the self-reported clinical worsening ( P < 0.05). Conclusions: Self-reported clinical worsening in people with PD living in Brazil during social distancing can also be aggravated by the precarious e/tele-health system, as perception of decreased physical activity volume and impoverishment in daily routine were some of the explanatory factors.

A method for measuring time spent in bradykinesia and dyskinesia in people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease using an ambulatory monitor,"Khodakarami, Hamid; Shokouhi, Navid; Horne, Malcolm",2021,Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation,"Parkinsonâ€™s,Fluctuations,Wearing-off,Sensors,Objective measurement,Off-time","Fluctuations in motor function in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) are frequent and cause significant disability. Frequently device assisted therapies are required to treat them. Currently, fluctuations are self-reported through diaries and history yet frequently people with PD do not accurately identify and report fluctuations. As the management of fluctuations and the outcomes of many clinical trials depend on accurately measuring fluctuations a means of objectively measuring time spent with bradykinesia or dyskinesia would be important. The aim of this study was to present a system that uses wearable sensors to measure the percentage of time that bradykinesia or dyskinesia scores are above a target as a means for assessing levels of treatment and fluctuations in PD. Data in a database of 228 people with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and 157 control subjects, who had worn the Parkinsonâ€™s Kinetigraph ((PKG, Global Kinetics Corporationâ„¢, Australia) and scores from the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and other clinic scales were used. The PKGâ€™s provided score for bradykinesia and dyskinesia every two minutes and these were compared to a previously established target range representing a UPDRS III score of 35. The proportion of these scores above target over the 6Â days that the PKG was worn were used to derive the percent time in bradykinesia (PTB) and percent time in dyskinesia (PTD). As well, a previously describe algorithm for estimating the amplitude of the levodopa response was used to determine whether a subject was a fluctuator or non-fluctuator. Using this approach, a normal range of PTB and PTD based on Control subject was developed. The level of PTB and PTD experienced by people with PD was compared with their levels of fluctuation. There was a correlation (Pearsonâ€™s Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.4) between UPDRS II scores and PTB: the correlation between Parkinson Disease Questionnaire scores and UPDRS Total scores and PTB and slightly lower. PTB and PTD fell in response to treatment for bradykinesia or dyskinesia (respectively) with greater sensitivity than clinical scales. This approach provides an objective assessment of the severity of fluctuations in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease that could be used in in clinical trials and routine care.

The associated motor symptoms are muscle rigidity or stiffness, bradykinesia, tremors, and gait disturbances. The correct diagnosis, especially in the initial stages, is fundamental to the life quality of the individual with PD. However, the methods used for diagnosis of PD are still based on subjective criteria. As a result, the objective of this study is the proposal of a method for the discrimination of individuals with PD (in the initial stages of the disease) from healthy groups, based on the inertial sensor recordings. A total of 27 participants were selected, 15 individuals previously diagnosed with PD and 12 healthy individuals. The data collection was performed using inertial sensors (positioned on the back of the hand and on the back of the forearm). Different numbers of features were used to compare the values of sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy of the classifiers. For group classification, 4 classifiers were used and compared, those being [Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB)]. When all individuals with PD were analyzed, the best performance for sensitivity and accuracy (0.875 and 0.800, respectively) was found in the SVM classifier, fed with 20% and 10% of the features, respectively, while the best performance for specificity and precision (0.933 and 0.917, respectively) was associated with the RF classifier fed with 20% of all the features. When only individuals with PD and score 1 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY) were analyzed, the best performances for sensitivity, precision and accuracy (0.933, 0.778 and 0.848, respectively) were from the SVM classifier, fed with 40% of all features, and the best result for precision (0.800) was connected to the NB classifier, fed with 20% of all features. Through an analysis of all individuals in this study with PD, the best classifier for the detection of PD (sensitivity) was the SVM fed with 20% of the features and the best classifier for ruling out PD (specificity) was the RF classifier fed with 20% of the features. When analyzing individuals with PD and score HYâ€‰=â€‰1, the SVM classifier was superior across the sensitivity, precision, and accuracy, and the NB classifier was superior in the specificity.

It causes incapability of walking, despite the PD patientâ€™s intention, resulting in loss of coordination that increases the risk of falls and injuries and severely affects the PD patientâ€™s quality of life. Stress, emotional stimulus, and multitasking have been encountered to be associated with the appearance of FoG episodes, while the patientâ€™s functionality and self-confidence are constantly deteriorating. This study suggests a non-invasive method for detecting FoG episodes, by analyzing inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. Specifically, accelerometer and gyroscope data from 11 PD subjects, as captured from a single wrist-worn IMU sensor during continuous walking, are processed via Deep Learning for window-based detection of the FoG events. The proposed approach, namely DeepFoG, was evaluated in a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation (CV) and 10-fold CV fashion schemes against its ability to correctly estimate the existence or not of a FoG episode at each data window. Experimental results have shown that DeepFoG performs satisfactorily, as it achieves 83%/88% and 86%/90% sensitivity/specificity, for LOSO CV and 10-fold CV schemes, respectively. The promising performance of the proposed DeepFoG reveals the potentiality of single-arm IMU-based real-time FoG detection that could guide effective interventions via stimuli, such as rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and hand vibration. In this way, DeepFoG may scaffold the elimination of risk of falls in PD patients, sustaining their quality of life in everyday living activities.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,,,frobt.2021.537384,research-article,

Clinical smartwatch measurements were acquired from a prospective study including 450 participants with PD, differential diagnoses (DD) and healthy participants. All participants wore two smartwatches throughout a 15-min examination. Symptoms and medical history were captured on the paired smartphone. The amplitude error of both smartwatches reaches up to 0.005 g, and for the measured frequencies, up to 0.01 Hz. A broad range of different ML classifiers were cross-validated. The most advanced task of distinguishing PD vs. DD was evaluated with 74.1% balanced accuracy, 86.5% precision and 90.5% recall by Multilayer Perceptrons. Deep-learning architectures significantly underperformed in all classification tasks. Smartwatches are capable of capturing subtle tremor signs with low noise. Amplitude and frequency differences between smartwatches and the seismometer were under the level of clinical significance.

To characterize essential tremor patients and their phenotypes in a Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias clinic population in the context of the new tremor classification. Demographic, clinical, historical, treatment, and diagnostic data were retrospectively collected on 300 patients diagnosed by Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia experts with essential tremor. Patients were classified as having essential tremor, essential tremor plus, or essential tremor-Parkinsonâ€™s disease combination, and features between these groups were compared. Of the 300 patients, 20.7% were classified as isolated essential tremor, 53.3% as essential tremor plus, and 26.0% as essential tremor-Parkinsonâ€™s disease. There was no significant difference in the duration of tremor symptoms. Essential tremor plus patients were more likely to have dystonia, tandem gait abnormalities, head tremor and greater tremor severity. Essential tremor-Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients were more likely to have RBD symptoms. There was no significant difference in cognitive impairment between essential tremor plus and essential tremor-Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients. Additional motor and non-motor features, including parkinsonism, are common in patients with essential tremor. Further studies are needed to clarify essential tremor phenotypes and to provide insights into possible subtypes. 300 patients with essential tremor from a Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias clinic were re-classified based on the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors.

Kinematic and Clinical Outcomes to Evaluate the Efficacy of a Multidisciplinary Intervention on Functional Mobility in Parkinson's Disease,"BouÃ§a-Machado, Raquel; Branco, Diogo; Fonseca, Gustavo; Fernandes, Raquel; Abreu, Daisy; Guerreiro, Tiago; Ferreira, Joaquim J.",2021,Frontiers in Neurology,"Parkinson's disease,functional mobility,outcome measures,gait,sensors,digital health,wearable,technology","Introduction: Functional mobility (FM) is a concept that incorporates the capacity of a person to move independently and safely to accomplish tasks. It has been proposed as a Parkinson's disease (PD) functional and global health outcome. In this study, we aimed to identify which kinematic and clinical outcomes changes better predict FM changes when PD patients are submitted to a specialized multidisciplinary program. Methods: PD patients engaged in a pre-defined specialized multidisciplinary program were assessed at admission and discharge. Change from baseline was calculated for all kinematic and clinical outcomes, and Timed Up and Go (TUG) was defined as the primary outcome for FM. A stepwise multivariate linear regression was performed to identify which outcome measures better predict TUG changes. Results: Twenty-four patients were included in the study. The changes in TUG Cognitive test, supervised step length, and free-living (FL) step time asymmetry were identified as the best predictors of TUG changes. The supervised step length and FL step time asymmetry were able to detect a small to moderate effect of the intervention ( d values ranging from âˆ’0.26 to 0.42). Conclusions: Our results support the use of kinematic outcome measures to evaluate the efficacy of multidisciplinary interventions on PD FM. The TUG Cognitive, step length, and FL step time asymmetry were identified as having the ability to predict TUG changes. More studies are needed to identify the minimal clinically important difference for step length and FL step time asymmetry in response to a multidisciplinary intervention for PD FM.",20<n<=30,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Wearable,,,,fneur.2021.637620,research-article,

The ubiquity of wrist-worn accelerometry suggests a possible sensor modality for early detection of PD symptoms and subsequent tracking of PD symptom severity. As an initial proof of concept for this technological approach, we analyzed the U.K. Biobank data set, consisting of one week of wrist-worn accelerometry from a population with a PD primary diagnosis and an age-matched healthy control population. Measures of movement dispersion were extracted from automatically segmented gait data, and measures of movement dimensionality were extracted from automatically segmented low-movement data. Using machine learning classifiers applied to one week of data, PD was detected with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69 on gait data, AUC = 0.84 on low-movement data, and AUC = 0.85 on a fusion of both activities. It was also found that classification accuracy steadily improved across the one-week data collection, suggesting that higher accuracy could be achievable from a longer data collection. These results suggest the viability of using a low-cost and easy-to-use activity sensor for detecting movement abnormalities due to PD and motivate further research on early PD detection and tracking of PD symptom severity.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,,,s21062047,research-article,

Those with primary VT first saw otolaryngology or speech language pathology (59%), whereas those with primary extremity/head tremor first saw neurology (36%). Documentation commonly omitted tremor clinical features such as (a) observed conditions of tremor (64%), (b) laryngeal features (64%), and (c) tremor frequency (92%). Thus, VT classification was based on comorbidity in 49% of patients (ie, essential tremor (48%), dystonia (72%), and Parkinson's disease (100%)) and 32% had inadequate documentation to classify. The majority of individuals with VT were unable to be classified based on documented clinical features highlighting the need for consistent multidisciplinary assessment of tremor affecting speech structures.

The aims of the present study were to determine the consistency between PD motor subtypes, to assess the stability of PD motor subtypes over time, and to explore the variables influencing PD motor subtype stability. This study was part of a longitudinal study of de novo PD patients at a single center. Based on three different motor subtype classification systems proposed by Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang, patients were respectively categorized as tremor-dominant/indeterminate/postural instability and gait difficulty (TD/indeterminate/PIGD), TD /mixed /akinetic-rigid (ARS), or TD /mixed /AR at baseline evaluation and then re-assessed 1 month later. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded at each evaluation. The consistency between subtypes at baseline evaluation was assessed using Cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient (Îº). Additional variables were compared between PD subtype groups using the two-sample t -test, Mannâ€“Whitney U -test or Chi-squared test. Of 283 newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients, 79 were followed up at 1 month. There was fair agreement between the Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang classification systems (Îº = 0.383 Â± 0.044, Îº = 0.360 Â± 0.042, Îº = 0.368 Â± 0.038). Among the three classification systems, the Schiess classification was the most stable and the Jankovic classification was the most unstable. The non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMSQuest) scores differed significantly between PD patients with stable and unstable subtypes based on the Jankovic classification ( p = 0.008), and patients with a consistent subtype had more severe NMSQuest scores than patients with an inconsistent subtype. Fair consistency was observed between the Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang classification systems. For the first time, non-motor symptoms (NMSs) scores were found to influence the stability of the TD/indeterminate/PIGD classification.

Using augmented reality technology for balance training in the older adults: a feasibility pilot study,"Blomqvist, Sven; Seipel, Stefan; EngstrÃ¶m, Maria",2021,BMC Geriatrics,"Fall,Training,Postural stability,Augmented reality","Impaired balance leading to falls is common in the older adults, and there is strong evidence that balance training reduces falls and increases independence. Reduced resources in health care will result in fewer people getting help with rehabilitation training. In this regard, the new technology augmented reality (AR) could be helpful. With AR, the older adults can receive help with instructions and get feedback on their progression in balance training. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of using AR-based visual-interactive tools in balance training of the older adults. Seven older adults (66â€“88â€‰years old) with impaired balance trained under supervision of a physiotherapist twice a week for six weeks using AR-based visual-interactive guidance, which was facilitated through a Microsoft HoloLens holographic display. Afterwards, participants and physiotherapists were interviewed about the new technology and their experience of the training. Also, fear of falling and balance ability were measured before and after training. Five participants experienced the new technology as positive in terms of increased motivation and feedback. Experiences were mixed regarding the physical and technical aspects of the HoloLens and the design of the HoloLens application. Participants also described issues that needed to be further improved, for example, the training program was difficult and monotonous. Further, the HoloLens hardware was felt to be heavy, the applicationâ€™s menu was difficult to control with different hand manoeuvres, and the calibration took a long time. Suggestions for improvements were described. Results of the balance tests and self-assessment instruments indicated no improvements in balance performance after AR training. The study showed that training with the new technology is, to some extent, feasible for the older adults, but needs further development. Also, the technology seemed to stimulate increased motivation, which is a prerequisite for adherence to training. However, the new technology and training requires further development and testing in a larger context.

Parkinson disease (PD) affects facial musculature leading to â€œhypomimiaâ€ or â€œmasked facies.â€ We aimed to determine whether modern computer vision techniques can be applied to detect masked facies and quantify drug states in PD. We trained a convolutional neural network on images extracted from videos of 107 self-identified people with PD, along with 1595 videos of controls, in order to detect PD hypomimia cues. This trained model was applied to clinical interviews of 35 PD patients in their on and off drug motor states, and seven journalist interviews of the actor Alan Alda obtained before and after he was diagnosed with PD. The algorithm achieved a test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 on 54 subjects to detect PD hypomimia, compared to a value of 0.75 for trained neurologists using the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-III Facial Expression score. Additionally, the model accuracy to classify the on and off drug states in the clinical samples was 63% (22/35), in contrast to an accuracy of 46% (16/35) when using clinical rater scores. Finally, each of Alan Aldaâ€™s seven interviews were successfully classified as occurring before (versus after) his diagnosis, with 100% accuracy (7/7). This proof-of-principle pilot study demonstrated that computer vision holds promise as a valuable tool for PD hypomimia and for monitoring a patientâ€™s motor state in an objective and noninvasive way, particularly given the increasing importance of telemedicine.",>30,,Diagnosis,Facial Expressions,Video Recording,,,,21037,research-article,

In this article, we have adapted the latest speaker recognition system, called x-vectors, in order to detect PD at an early stage using voice analysis. X-vectors are embeddings extracted from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which provide robust speaker representations and improve speaker recognition when large amounts of training data are used. Our goal was to assess whether, in the context of early PD detection, this technique would outperform the more standard classifier MFCC-GMM (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficientsâ€”Gaussian Mixture Model) and, if so, under which conditions. We recorded 221 French speakers (recently diagnosed PD subjects and healthy controls) with a high-quality microphone and via the telephone network. Men and women were analyzed separately in order to have more precise models and to assess a possible gender effect. Several experimental and methodological aspects were tested in order to analyze their impacts on classification performance. We assessed the impact of the audio segment durations, data augmentation, type of dataset used for the neural network training, kind of speech tasks, and back-end analyses. X-vectors technique provided better classification performances than MFCC-GMM for the text-independent tasks, and seemed to be particularly suited for the early detection of PD in women (7â€“15% improvement).

Greater agreement was found for items characterizing tremor than for signs of dystonia. Clinical signs leading to diagnostic disagreement were identified with STEA, and STEA should therefore be useful in future studies of diagnostic disagreement.

For use in daily life, the detection performance needs to be evaluated in curved walking and turning as well as in single-task and dual-task conditions. Participants (older adults, people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, or people who had suffered from a stroke) performed three different walking trials: (1) straight-line walking, (2) slalom walking, (3) Stroop-and-walk trial. An optical motion capture system was used a reference system. Markers were attached to the heel and toe regions of the shoe, and participants wore IMUs on the lateral sides of both shanks. The angular velocity of the shank IMUs was used to detect instances of initial foot contact (IC) and final foot contact (FC), which were compared to reference values obtained from the marker trajectories. The detection method showed high recall, precision and F1 scores in different populations for both initial contacts and final contacts during straight-line walking (IC: recall 100%, precision 100%, F1 score 100%; FC: recall 100%, precision 100%, F1 score 100%), slalom walking (IC: recall 100%, precision 99%, F1 score 100%; FC: recall 100%, precision 99%, F1 score 100%), and turning (IC: recall 85%, precision 95%, F1 score 91%; FC: recall 84%, precision 95%, F1 score 89%).

Such predictions may be used for the administration of cues, in order to prevent the occurrence of gait freezing. The aim of the present study was to propose a wearable system able to catch the typical degradation of the walking pattern preceding FOG episodes, to achieve reliable FOG prediction using machine learning algorithms and verify whether dopaminergic therapy affects the ability of our system to detect and predict FOG. Methods: A cohort of 11 Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients receiving (on) and not receiving (off) dopaminergic therapy was equipped with two inertial sensors placed on each shin, and asked to perform a timed up and go test. We performed a step-to-step segmentation of the angular velocity signals and subsequent feature extraction from both time and frequency domains. We employed a wrapper approach for feature selection and optimized different machine learning classifiers in order to catch FOG and pre-FOG episodes. Results: The implemented FOG detection algorithm achieved excellent performance in a leave-one-subject-out validation, in patients both on and off therapy. As for pre-FOG detection, the implemented classification algorithm achieved 84.1% (85.5%) sensitivity, 85.9% (86.3%) specificity and 85.5% (86.1%) accuracy in leave-one-subject-out validation, in patients on (off) therapy. When the classification model was trained with data from patients on (off) and tested on patients off (on), we found 84.0% (56.6%) sensitivity, 88.3% (92.5%) specificity and 87.4% (86.3%) accuracy. Conclusions: Machine learning models are capable of predicting FOG before its actual occurrence with adequate accuracy. The dopaminergic therapy affects pre-FOG gait patterns, thereby influencing the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,,,s21020614,research-article,

Objectives: To develop a computer application using the Microsoft Kinect sensor to assess performance-related bradykinesia. Methods: The developed application ( Motorgame ) was tested in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. Participants were assessed with the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and standardized clinical side effect rating scales, i.e., UKU Side Effect Rating Scale and Simpson-Angus Scale. Additionally, tests of information processing (Symbol Coding Task) and motor speed (Token Motor Task), together with a questionnaire, were applied. Results: Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease and 33 healthy controls were assessed. In the patient group, there was a statistically significant ( p < 0.05) association between prolonged time of motor performance in the Motorgame and upper body rigidity and bradykinesia (MDS-UPDRS) with the strongest effects in the right hand ( p < 0.001). In the entire group, prolonged time of motor performance was significantly associated with higher Simson-Angus scale rigidity score and higher UKU hypokinesia scores ( p < 0.05). A shortened time of motor performance was significantly associated with higher scores on information processing ( p < 0.05). Time of motor performance was not significantly associated with Token Motor Task, duration of illness, or hours of daily physical activity. The Motorgame was well-accepted. Conclusions: In the present feasibility study the Motorgame was able to detect common motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful way, making it applicable for further testing in larger samples.",>30,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Video Recording,,,,fneur.2020.610614,research-article,

We compared gait variability at different walking velocities between and within groups of patients with Parkinson-variant multiple system atrophy, idiopathic Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and a control group of older adults. Gait metrics were recorded in 11 multiple system atrophy, 12 Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients, and 18 controls using sensor-based gait analysis. Gait variability was analyzed for stride, swing and stance time, stride length and gait velocity. Values were compared between and within the groups at self-paced comfortable, fast and slow walking speed. Multiple system atrophy patients displayed higher gait variability except for stride time at all velocities compared with controls, while Parkinsonâ€™s patients did not. Compared with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, multiple system atrophy patients displayed higher variability of swing time, stride length and gait velocity at comfortable speed and at slow speed for swing and stance time, stride length and gait velocity (all P â€‰<â€‰0.05). Stride time variability was significantly higher in slow compared to comfortable walking in patients with multiple system atrophy ( P â€‰=â€‰0.014). Variability parameters significantly correlated with the postural instability/gait difficulty subscore in both disease groups. Conversely, significant correlations between variability parameters and MDS-UPDRS III score was observed only for multiple system atrophy patients. This analysis suggests that gait variability parameters reflect the major axial impairment and postural instability displayed by multiple system atrophy patients compared with Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients and controls.

Feasibility of a novice electronic psychometric assessment system for cognitively impaired,"Jee, Haemi; Park, Jaehyun",2020,Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation,"Cognitive dysfunction,Golden standard,Psychometric test,Line tracing test","The assessment and rehabilitation of patients with cognitive dysfunction is a field that currently requires assistive technology. While the paper-and-pencil test, such as the line tracing test, is one of the commonly used assessment methods for cognitive dysfunction, accuracy, and time-consuming assessment process needed technological application. The aim of this study was therefore to establish a computer-based real-time assessment system (e-system) for patients without compromising the usefulness of the conventional paper-and-pencil based user tools with 50 healthy participants. The comparison of the e-system with the golden-standard assessment (evaluator) results showed high concordance correlation coefficients of 0.89 and 0.87 and small effective sizes of 0.27 and 0.27 between two repeated measures. The Bland-Altman plots also showed smaller degree of error and greater repeatability in comparison to the repeated measures. Moreover, the accuracy rates of 96.5% and 96.4% were shown. The results indicated feasibility of the novice e-system. The e-system may assist rehabilitation specialists to assess and diagnose patients with cognitive dysfunction. This system can be applied to a range of assessment and rehabilitation modalities based on pen and paper. It can also be used for various patients such as those with Parkinson disease, stroke, or different forms of brain lesions.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Other,,,,jer.2040828.414,research-article,

The presence of rest tremor (RT) and action tremor (AT; defined as combination of both postural and kinetic tremor) was determined and RT severity was defined using the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias Society Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) at baseline in the Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI, n = 423), the Fox Investigation for New Discovery of Biomarkers (BioFIND, n = 118) and the Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP, n = 873) cohorts. Across baseline data of all three cohorts, RT prevalence (58.2%) was higher than AT prevalence (39.0%). Patients with RT had significantly higher (Chi-square test, p < 0.05) prevalence of AT compared to patients without RT in the PPMI (40.0% versus 30.1%), BioFIND (48.0% versus 40.0%) and PDBP (49.9% versus 21.0%) cohorts. Furthermore, patients with AT had significantly (Student t-test, p < 0.05) higher RT severity that those without AT in PPMI (5.7 Â± 5.4 versus 3.9 Â± 3.3), BioFIND, 6.4 Â± 6.3 versus 3.8 Â± 4.4) and PDBP (6.4 Â± 6.6 versus 3.7 Â± 4.4) cohorts. In the BioFIND cohort, the prevalence of all types of tremor and their combinations significantly decreased from the off-state to on-state. The RT is the most frequent tremor type and present in more than half of the PD patients. However, AT is also present in nearly one-third of the PD patients. Our results also indicate that RT and AT may have cross-interactions in PD, and that dopaminergic treatment influences both RT and AT.",,,Diagnosis,Tremor,Wearable,,,,tohm.552,research-article,

Previous research examined factors contributing to this deterioration. Among them, changes in brain cortical activity during walking have been less studied in this clinical population. Objectives: This study aimed to: (1) investigate changes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation during usual walking and dual-task walking conditions in patients with PD; (2) examine the association between cortical activity and behavioral/cognitive outcomes; and (3) explore which factors best predict increased activation of the DLPFC during usual walking. Methods: Eighteen patients with early stage PD and 18 controls performed 4 conditions: (1) standing while subtracting, (2) usual walking, (3) walking while counting forward, and (4) walking while subtracting. Cortical activity in DLPFC, assessed by changes in oxy-hemoglobin (Î”HbO 2 ) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Î”HbR), was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Gait performance was recorded using wearables sensors. Cognition was also assessed using neuropsychological tests, including the Trail Making Test (TMT). Results: DLPFC activity was higher in patients compared to controls during both usual walking and walking while subtracting conditions. Patients had impaired walking performance compared to controls only during walking while subtracting task. Moderate-to-strong correlations between Î”HbO 2 and coefficients of variation of all gait parameters were found for usual walking and during walking while counting forward conditions. Part-B of TMT predicted 21% of the variance of Î”HbO 2 during usual walking after adjustment for group status. Conclusions: The increased DLPFC activity in patients during usual walking suggests a potential compensation for executive deficits. Understanding changes in DLPFC activity during walking may have implications for rehabilitation of gait in patients with PD.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Wearable,,,,fneur.2020.601686,research-article,

An Intelligent Mobile-Enabled System for Diagnosing Parkinson Disease: Development and Validation of a Speech Impairment Detection System,,2020,JMIR Medical Informatics,"Parkinson disease,speech disorder,remote diagnosis,artificial intelligence,mobile phone app,mobile health","Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological diseases. At present, because the exact cause is still unclear, accurate diagnosis and progression monitoring remain challenging. In recent years, exploring the relationship between PD and speech impairment has attracted widespread attention in the academic world. Most of the studies successfully validated the effectiveness of some vocal features. Moreover, the noninvasive nature of speech signalâ€“based testing has pioneered a new way for telediagnosis and telemonitoring. In particular, there is an increasing demand for artificial intelligenceâ€“powered tools in the digital health era. This study aimed to build a real-time speech signal analysis tool for PD diagnosis and severity assessment. Further, the underlying system should be flexible enough to integrate any machine learning or deep learning algorithm. At its core, the system we built consists of two parts: (1) speech signal processing: both traditional and novel speech signal processing technologies have been employed for feature engineering, which can automatically extract a few linear and nonlinear dysphonia features, and (2) application of machine learning algorithms: some classical regression and classification algorithms from the machine learning field have been tested; we then chose the most efficient algorithms and relevant features. Experimental results showed that our system had an outstanding ability to both diagnose and assess severity of PD. By using both linear and nonlinear dysphonia features, the accuracy reached 88.74% and recall reached 97.03% in the diagnosis task. Meanwhile, mean absolute error was 3.7699 in the assessment task. The system has already been deployed within a mobile app called No Pa. This study performed diagnosis and severity assessment of PD from the perspective of speech order detection. The efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms indirectly validated the practicality of the system. In particular, the system reflects the necessity of a publicly accessible PD diagnosis and assessment system that can perform telediagnosis and telemonitoring of PD.

Speech deterioration (hypokinetic dysarthria) is a common symptom, which often presents early in the disease course. Machine learning can help Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias specialists improve their diagnostic accuracy using non-invasive and inexpensive voice recordings. We used â€œParkinson Dataset with Replicated Acoustic Features Data Setâ€ from the UCI-Machine Learning repository. The dataset included 44 speech-test based acoustic features from patients with PD and controls. We analyzed the data using various machine learning algorithms including Light and Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighborhood, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression, as well as logistic regression. We also implemented a variable importance analysis to identify important variables classifying patients with PD. The cohort included a total of 80 subjects: 40 patients with PD (55% men) and 40 controls (67.5% men). Disease duration was 5â€‰years or less for all subjects, with a mean Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score of 19.6 (SD 8.1), and none were taking PD medication. The mean age for PD subjects and controls was 69.6 (SD 7.8) and 66.4 (SD 8.4), respectively. Our best-performing model used Light Gradient Boosting to provide an AUC of 0.951 with 95% confidence interval 0.946â€“0.955 in 4-fold cross validation using only seven acoustic features.

Importantly, previous studies have suggested protective effects of physical activity in PD. However, the relationships between conventional clinical ratings for PD and three-axis accelerometer measures of physical activity (e.g., daily physical activity levels [PAL] or metabolic equivalents of task [METs]) are still unclear, particularly for METs. In the current study, we sought to elucidate these relationships on a daily basis, and to clarify optimal predictors for clinical states on a 30-min basis. Patients who were hospitalized for adjustment of drugs or deep brain stimulation were enrolled. Using waist-worn three-axis accelerometers, PAL and METs parameter data were obtained and compared with UPDRS-3[On] and symptom diary data. We extracted data from the patientsâ€™ best and worst days, defined by the best and worst UPDRS-3[On] scores, respectively. Thus, 22 data sets from 11 patients were extracted. We examined the correlations and produced scatter plots to represent the relationships, then investigated which METs parameters and activity patterns were the best predictors for â€œOnâ€ and â€œdyskinesiaâ€. The parameter â€œmean METs value within the 95â€“92.5 percentile range on a day (95â€“92.5 percentile value)â€ exhibited the strongest correlation with conventional daily clinical ratings ( Rho : âˆ’â€‰0.799 for UPDRS-3[On], 0.803 for On hours [ p â€‰<â€‰0.001]). Scatter plots suggested that PAL tended to have higher values in patients with involuntary movement. However, METs parameters focusing on higher METs seemed to alleviate this tendency. We clarified that â€œtime over 2.0 METsâ€ and â€œtime over 1.5 METsâ€ could be predictors for â€œOnâ€ and â€œdyskinesiaâ€ on a 30-min basis, respectively (AUROC: 0.779 and 0.959, 95% CI: 0.733â€“0.824 and 0.918â€“1.000). The specificity and sensitivity of the optimal activity pattern for â€œOnâ€ were 0.858 and 0.621. This study suggested feasible activity patterns and METs parameters for objective evaluation of motor symptoms on a 30-min or daily basis. Three-axis accelerometer measures focusing on higher METs may be appropriate for evaluating physical activity.

People with Parkinson disease with and without freezing of gait respond similarly to external and self-generated cues,"Horin, Adam P.; Harrison, Elinor C.; Rawson, Kerri S.; Earhart, Gammon M.",2020,Gait & posture,"Parkinson disease,Gait variability,Falls,Freezing","Gait deficits in Parkinson disease (PD), including freezing of gait (FOG), can be among the most debilitating symptoms. Rhythmic auditory cueing has been used to alleviate some gait symptoms. However, different cue types, such as externally-generated and self-generated cues, affect gait variability differently. The differential effects of these cue types on people with PD with FOG (PD+FOG), who often have higher gait variability, and those with PD without FOG (PD-FOG) is unknown. Given the relationship of gait variability to fall risk, this is an important area to address. This study aims to 1) confirm the association between falls and gait variability measures in PD-FOG, PD+FOG and age-matched Controls; 2) investigate the effects of different cue types on gait variability in PD-FOG and PD+FOG; and 3) determine whether baseline gait characteristics are associated with response to cues. This cross-sectional study investigated PD-FOG (n=24), PD+FOG (n=20), and Controls (n=24). Gait trials were collected during use of externally-generated and self-generated cues for all participants. Gait variability measures were the primary outcomes to assess the effects of rhythmic auditory cues. Logistic regression models showed increased gait variability was associated with falls across groups. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed externally-generated cues increased gait variability, whereas self-generated cues did not, for all groups. Pearsonâ€™s correlations showed participants with higher baseline gait variability had greater reduction in gait variability with rhythmic auditory cueing. Higher gait variability is associated with falls. This study demonstrates that PD+FOG are capable of using self-generated cues without increasing gait variability measures, thereby stabilizing gait. People with higher baseline gait variability are likely to experience the largest reductions in variability with the addition of external cues.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,,,j.gaitpost.2020.09.005,research-article,

This study proposes methods to diagnose PD through facial expression recognition. We collected videos of facial expressions of people with PD and matched controls. We used relative coordinates and positional jitter to extract facial expression features (facial expression amplitude and shaking of small facial muscle groups) from the key points returned by Face++. Algorithms from traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning were utilized to diagnose PD. The experimental results showed our models can achieve outstanding facial expression recognition ability for PD diagnosis. Applying a long short-term model neural network to the positions of the key features, precision and F1 values of 86% and 75%, respectively, can be reached. Further, utilizing a support vector machine algorithm for the facial expression amplitude features and shaking of the small facial muscle groups, an F1 value of 99% can be achieved. This study contributes to the digital diagnosis of PD based on facial expression recognition. The disease diagnosis model was validated through our experiment. The results can help doctors understand the real-time dynamics of the disease and even conduct remote diagnosis.",,,Diagnosis,Facial Expressions,Video Recording,,,,18697,research-article,

Because of its relevance to the abnormality of the brain, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is used for the early detection of this disease. This paper introduces a novel computer-aided diagnosis method to detect PD, which is an efficient deep learning method based on a pooling-based deep recurrent neural network (PDRNN). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease based on deep recurrent neural network of EEG signal The EEG signals of 20 patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease and 20 healthy people in Henan Provincial Peopleâ€™s Hospital (Peopleâ€™s Hospital of Zhengzhou University) were examined, and a PDRNN learning method was applied on the dataset for managing the demand of the traditional feature presentation step. The suggested DPRNN network gives the precision, sensitivity and specificity of 88.31%, 84.84% and 91.81%, respectively. Nevertheless, 11.28% of the healthy cases are wrongly categorized in Parkinson class. Also, 11.49% percent of Parkinson cases are classified wrongly in the healthy class. The experimental model has high efficiency and can be used as a reliable tool for clinical PD detection. In future research, more cases should be used to test and develop the proposed model.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,BioPotential,,,,atm-20-5100,research-article,
Feasibility and Utility of mHealth for the Remote Monitoring of Parkinson Disease: Ancillary Study of the PD_manager Randomized Controlled Trial,,2020,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"Parkinson's disease,determinants of compliance,clinically meaningful data,ecological validity","Mobile health, predominantly wearable technology and mobile apps, have been considered in Parkinson disease to provide valuable ecological data between face-to-face visits and improve monitoring of motor symptoms remotely. We explored the feasibility of using a technology-based mHealth platform comprising a smartphone in combination with a smartwatch and a pair of smart insoles, described in this study as the PD_manager system, to collect clinically meaningful data. We also explored outcomes and disease-related factors that are important determinants to establish feasibility. Finally, we further validated a tremor evaluation method with data collected while patients performed their daily activities. PD_manager trial was an open-label parallel group randomized study.The mHealth platform consists of a wristband, a pair of sensor insoles, a smartphone (with dedicated mobile Android apps) and a knowledge platform serving as the cloud backend. Compliance was assessed with statistical analysis and the factors affecting it using appropriate regression analysis. The correlation of the scores of our previous algorithm for tremor evaluation and the respective Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale estimations by clinicians were explored. Of the 75 study participants, 65 (87%) completed the protocol. They used the PD_manager system for a median 11.57 (SD 3.15) days. Regression analysis suggests that the main factor associated with high use was caregiversâ€™ burden. Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living and patientsâ€™ self-rated health status also influence the systemâ€™s use. Our algorithm provided clinically meaningful data for the detection and evaluation of tremor. We found that PD patients, regardless of their demographics and disease characteristics, used the system for 11 to 14 days. The study further supports that mHealth can be an effective tool for the ecologically valid, passive, unobtrusive monitoring and evaluation of symptoms. Future studies will be required to demonstrate that an mHealth platform can improve disease management and care.

Enhancement of Neurocognitive Assessments Using Smartphone Capabilities: Systematic Review,,2020,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"mobile phone,mobile health,neurocognitive tests,neurodegenerative disease,neurocognitive disorders","Comprehensive exams such as the Dean-Woodcock Neuropsychological Assessment System, the Global Deterioration Scale, and the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination are the gold standard for doctors and clinicians in the preliminary assessment and monitoring of neurocognitive function in conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and acquired brain injuries (ABIs). In recent years, there has been an increased focus on implementing these exams on mobile devices to benefit from their configurable built-in sensors, in addition to scoring, interpretation, and storage capabilities. As smartphones become more accepted in health care among both users and clinicians, the ability to use device information (eg, device position, screen interactions, and app usage) for subject monitoring also increases. Sensor-based assessments (eg, functional gait using a mobile deviceâ€™s accelerometer and/or gyroscope or collection of speech samples using recordings from the deviceâ€™s microphone) include the potential for enhanced information for diagnoses of neurological conditions; mapping the development of these conditions over time; and monitoring efficient, evidence-based rehabilitation programs. This paper provides an overview of neurocognitive conditions and relevant functions of interest, analysis of recent results using smartphone and/or tablet built-in sensor information for the assessment of these different neurocognitive conditions, and how human-device interactions and the assessment and monitoring of these neurocognitive functions can be enhanced for both the patient and health care provider. This survey presents a review of current mobile technological capabilities to enhance the assessment of various neurocognitive conditions, including both neurodegenerative diseases and ABIs. It explores how device features can be configured for assessments as well as the enhanced capability and data monitoring that will arise due to the addition of these features. It also recognizes the challenges that will be apparent with the transfer of these current assessments to mobile devices. Built-in sensor information on mobile devices is found to provide information that can enhance neurocognitive assessment and monitoring across all functional categories. Configurations of positional sensors (eg, accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS), media sensors (eg, microphone and camera), inherent sensors (eg, device timer), and participatory user-device interactions (eg, screen interactions, metadata input, app usage, and device lock and unlock) are all helpful for assessing these functions for the purposes of training, monitoring, diagnosis, or rehabilitation. This survey discusses some of the many opportunities and challenges of implementing configured built-in sensors on mobile devices to enhance assessments and monitoring of neurocognitive functions as well as disease progression across neurodegenerative and acquired neurological conditions.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Smartphone,,,,15517,research-article,

The data acquisition was performed within different environments from multiple individuals with distinct types of diseases. Then this data was analyzed to estimate the various parameters of the Timed-Up and Go test. Firstly, the pressure sensor is used to extract the reaction and total test time. Secondly, the magnetometer sensors are used to identify the total test time and different parameters related to turning around. Finally, the accelerometer sensor is used to extract the reaction time, total test time, duration of turning around, going time, return time, and many other derived metrics. Our experiments showed that these parameters could be automatically and reliably detected with a mobile device.

Patients ( N â€‰=â€‰240) with early-stage neurological (peripheral vestibular, cerebellar, hypokinetic, vascular or functional) gait disorders and healthy controls ( N â€‰=â€‰35) were clinically assessed with standardized scores related to functional mobility, balance confidence, quality of life, cognitive function, and fall history. Subsequently, daily mobility was recorded for 14Â days by means of a body-worn inertial sensor (ActivPAL Â® ). Fourteen mobility measures derived from ActivPAL recordings were submitted to principle component analysis (PCA). Group differences within each factor obtained from PCA were analyzed and hierarchical regression analysis was performed to identify predictive characteristics from clinical assessment for each factor. PCA yielded five significant orthogonal factors (i.e., mobility domains) accounting for 92.3% of the total variance from inertial-sensor-recordings: ambulatory volume (38.7%), ambulatory pattern (22.3%), postural transitions (13.3%), sedentary volume (10.8%), and sedentary pattern (7.2%). Patients' mobility performance only exhibited reduced scores in the ambulatory volume domain but near-to-normal scores in all remaining domains. Demographic characteristics, clinical scores, and fall history were differentially associated with each domain explaining 19.2â€“10.2% of their total variance. This study supportsÂ a low-dimensional five-domain model for daily mobility behavior in patients with neurological gait disorders that may facilitate monitoring the course of disease or therapeutic intervention effects in ecologically valid and clinically relevant contexts. Further studies are required to explore the determinants that may explain performance differences of patients within each of these domains and to examine the consequences of altered mobility behavior with respect to patients' risk of falling and quality of life.",>30,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Wearable,,,,s00415-020-09893-2,research-article,

Due to parkinsonian features that overlap those of Parkinson's disease, the differentiation of voice and a speech disorder is a challenge for clinicians primarily in the early stage of the disease. Speech samples were obtained from 116 subjects including 30 cases of Parkinson's disease, 30 cases of progressive supranuclear palsy, 30 cases of multiple system atrophy, and control group consisted of 26 subjects. Differential diagnosis of dysarthria subtypes was based on the quantitative, acoustic analysis of particular speech components. Additionally, Voice Handicap Index questionnaire was taken into account to differentiate the severity of voice impairment in the study groups. Our results showed significant differences in the distribution of acoustic parameters between Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. A mixed type of dysarthria with a combination of hypokinetic, spastic, and atactic features has been found in patients with atypical parkinsonism. In patients with the clinical diagnosis of the parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy, ataxic components of dysarthria were observed. Patients with PD presented pure hypokinetic dysarthria. Some parameters may be used as a marker for the diagnosis of the initial stage of PD. Voice impartment was significantly more frequent and severe in atypical parkinsonism than in Parkinson's disease. Acoustic voice analysis is a very sensitive and noninvasive tool, provides objective information for the assessment of different speech components, has the specific potential to provide quantitative data essential for the improvement of the diagnostic process, and maybe aÂ useful instrument in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,brb3.1700,research-article,

The aim of the current study is to determine test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and face validity of HoloLens 1 for quantifying spatiotemporal gait parameters. This was done in a group of 23 healthy young adults (mean age 21 years) walking at slow, comfortable, and fast speeds, as well as in a group of 24 people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (mean age 67 years) walking at comfortable speed. Walking was concurrently measured with HoloLens 1 and a previously validated markerless reference motion-registration system. We comprehensively evaluated HoloLens 1 for parameterizing walking (i.e., walking speed, step length and cadence) in terms of test-retest reliability (i.e., consistency over repetitions) and concurrent validity (i.e., between-systems agreement), using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Blandâ€“Altmanâ€™s bias and limits of agreement. Test-retest reliability and between-systems agreement were excellent for walking speed (ICC â‰¥ 0.861), step length (ICC â‰¥ 0.884), and cadence (ICC â‰¥ 0.765), with narrower between-systems than over-repetitions limits of agreement. Face validity was demonstrated with significantly different walking speeds, step lengths and cadences over walking-speed conditions. To conclude, walking speed, step length, and cadence can be reliably and validly quantified from the position data of the wearable HoloLens 1 measurement system, not only for a broad range of speeds in healthy young adults, but also for self-selected comfortable speed in people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,,,s20113216,research-article,

This study compared Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)â€™s non-motor symptoms and the diagnostic predictive power of cognitive profiles that distinguish AD and PD using machine learning. This study analyzed 118 patients with AD and 110 patients with PDD, and all subjects were 60 years or older. In order to develop the PDD prediction model, the dataset was divided into training data (70%) and test data (30%). The prediction accuracy of the model was calculated by the recognition rate. The results of this study show that Parkinson-related non-motor symptoms, such as REM sleep behavior disorders, and cognitive screening tests, such as Korean version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment, were highly accurate factors for predicting PDD. It is required to develop customized screening tests that can detect PDD in the early stage based on these results. Furthermore, it is believed that including biomarkers such as brain images or cerebrospinal fluid as input variables will be more useful for developing PDD prediction models in the future.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Other,,,,jpm10020031,research-article,

The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between axial ROM and axial rigidity, the functional mobility and HRQoL in patients with mild to moderate PD. Methods: An exploratory study was conducted. Non-probabilistic sampling of consecutive cases was used. Active trunk ROM was assessed by a universal goniometer. A Biodex System isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure the rigidity of the trunk. Functional mobility was determined by the Get Up and Go (GUG) test, and HRQoL was assessed with the PDQ-39 and EuroQol-5D questionnaires. Results: Thirty-six mild to moderate patients with PD were evaluated. Significant correlations were observed between trunk extensors rigidity and trunk flexion and extension ROM. Significant correlations were observed between trunk flexion, extension and rotation ROM and GUG. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between trunk ROM for flexion, extension and rotations (both sides) and PDQ-39 total score. However, these correlations were considered poor. Conclusions: Trunk ROM for flexion and extension movements, measured by a universal goniometer, were correlated with axial extensors rigidity, evaluated by a technological device at 30Â°/s and 45Â°/s, and functional mobility.

The sample consisted of 30 persons with mild-to-moderate PD and 30 controls matched by age and sex. Participants performed a 6-minute bout of over-ground walking at comfortable speed, and then completed three, 6-minute bouts of treadmill walking at 13.4 metersÂ·min âˆ’1 slower, comfortable, and 13.4 metersÂ·min âˆ’1 faster than comfortable speeds. The three treadmill speeds were based on the initial over-ground walking speed. The total number of steps per treadmill walking bout was recorded using a hand-tally counter, and energy expenditure was measured using a portable, indirect spirometry system. The results indicated a strong association between step-rate and energy expenditure for persons with PD ( R =0.92) and controls ( R =0.92). The analyses further indicated a steeper slope of the association for persons with PD compared with controls ( t (58)=â€“1.87, p< 0.05), resulting in a lower step-rate threshold ( t (58)=2.19, p <0.05) for persons with PD (~80 stepsÂ·min âˆ’1 ) than controls (~93 stepsÂ·min âˆ’1 ).

We acquired a dataset of 8,661â€‰minutes of IMU data from 30 patients, with annotations about the motor state (OFF,ON, DYSKINETIC) based on MDS-UPDRS global bradykinesia item and the AIMS upper limb dyskinesia item.

However, the varying impact of specific symptoms and their interactions on a person's motor repertoire is not understood. The current study investigates the possibility to predict global motor disabilities based on the patient symptomatology and medication. Methods: A cohort of 115 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (mean age = 67.0 Â± 8.7 years old) participated in the study. Participants performed different tasks, including the Timed-Up & Go, eating soup and the Purdue Pegboard test. Performance on these tasks was judged using timing, number of errors committed, and count achieved. K-means method was used to cluster the overall performance and create different motor performance groups. Symptomatology was objectively assessed for each participant from a combination of wearable inertial sensors (bradykinesia, tremor, dyskinesia) and clinical assessment (rigidity, postural instability). A multinomial regression model was derived to predict the performance cluster membership based on the patients' symptomatology, socio-demographics information and medication. Results: Clustering exposed four distinct performance groups: normal behavior, slightly affected in fine motor tasks, affected only in TUG, and affected in all areas. The statistical model revealed that low to moderate level of dyskinesia increased the likelihood of being in the normal group. A rise in postural instability and rest tremor increase the chance to be affected in TUG. Finally, LEDD did not help distinguishing between groups, but the presence of Amantadine as part of the medication regimen appears to decrease the likelihood of being part of the groups affected in TUG.

Still, the contribution of the basal ganglia and dopamine on the feedforward postural control associated with this motor task is poorly known. In addition, the influence of anthropometric measures (AM) and initial stance condition on GI has never been consistently assessed. The biomechanical resultants of anticipatory postural adjustments contributing to GI [imbalance (IMB), unloading (UNL), and stepping phase) were studied in 26 unmedicated subjects with idiopathic PD and in 27 healthy subjects. A subset of 13 patients was analyzed under standardized medication conditions and the striatal dopaminergic innervation was studied in 22 patients using FP-CIT and SPECT. People with PD showed a significant reduction in center of pressure (CoP) displacement and velocity during the IMB phase, reduced first step length and velocity, and decreased velocity and acceleration of the center of mass (CoM) at toe off of the stance foot. All these measurements correlated with the dopaminergic innervation of the putamen and substantially improved with levodopa. These results were not influenced by anthropometric parameters or by the initial stance condition. In contrast, most of the measurements of the UNL phase were influenced by the foot placement and did not correlate with putaminal dopaminergic innervation. Our results suggest a significant role of dopamine and the putamen particularly in the elaboration of the IMB phase of anticipatory postural adjustments and in the execution of the first step.

Methods: 74 PPD (HY stages: 23 in stage 1; 31 in stage 2; 20 in stage 3), without dementia (MoCA cut-off 21), tested in ON period with dopaminergic medication were submitted to single individual cognitive/motor evaluation sessions. MoCA and GG were used to assess cognition, and the dynamic gait index (DGI) test was used to assess gait performance under complex condition. GG test resulted in 9 measures extracted via a statistical model. The predictive power of the GG measures and the MoCA score with respect to gait performance, as assessed by DGI, were compared. Results: The predictive models based on GG obtained a better score of prediction (65%) then MoCA (56%) for DGI scores (at a 50% specificity).

Parkinson patients without tremor show changed patterns of mechanical muscle oscillations during a specific bilateral motor task compared to controls,"Schaefer, Laura V.; Bittmann, Frank N.",2020,Scientific Reports,"Parkinson's disease,Parkinson's disease,Parkinson's disease,Motor control,Neurophysiology","The pathophysiology of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is still not understood. There are investigations which show a changed oscillatory behaviour of brain circuits or changes in variability of, e.g., gait parameters in PD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not the motor output differs between PD patients and healthy controls. Thereby, patients without tremor are investigated in the medication off state performing a special bilateral isometric motor task. The force and accelerations (ACC) were recorded as well as the Mechanomyography (MMG) of the biceps brachii, the brachioradialis and of the pectoralis major muscles using piezoelectric-sensors during the bilateral motor task at 60% of the maximal isometric contraction. The frequency, a specific power ratio, the amplitude variation and the slope of amplitudes were analysed. The results indicate that the oscillatory behaviour of motor output in PD patientsÂ without tremor deviates from controls: thereby, the 95%-confidence-intervals of power ratio and of amplitude variation of all signals are disjoint between PD and controls and show significant differences in group comparisons (power ratio: pâ€‰=â€‰0.000â€“0.004, râ€‰=â€‰0.441â€“0.579; amplitude variation: pâ€‰=â€‰0.000â€“0.001, râ€‰=â€‰0.37â€“0.67). The mean frequency shows a significant difference for ACC (pâ€‰=â€‰0.009, râ€‰=â€‰0.43), but not for MMG.

However, many falls occur while walking and so promoting activity might paradoxically increase fall rates, causing injuries, and worse quality of life. The relationship between activity exposure and fall rates remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between walking activity (exposure to risk) and fall rates before and after an exercise program (V-TIME). One hundred and nine older fallers, 38 fallers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 128 fallers with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) were randomly assigned to one of two active interventions: treadmill training only or treadmill training combined with a virtual reality component. Participants were tested before and after the interventions. Free-living walking activity was characterized by volume, pattern, and variability of ambulatory bouts using an accelerometer positioned on the lower back for 1 week. To evaluate that relationship between fall risk and activity, a normalized index was determined expressing fall rates relative to activity exposure (FRA index), with higher scores indicating a higher risk of falls per steps taken. At baseline, the FRA index was higher for fallers with PD compared to those with MCI and older fallers. Walking activity did not change after the intervention for the groups but the FRA index decreased significantly for all groups ( p â€…â‰¤â€….035). This work showed that V-TIME interventions reduced falls risk without concurrent change in walking activity. We recommend using the FRA index in future fall prevention studies to better understand the nature of intervention programs.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Other,,,,glaa007,research-article,

Shriram,2020,2020 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP),Parkinson's disease;Motor Symptoms;Non-motor symptoms;Smell;Sweat;VOC Sensor,"Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative and intensifying disorder. The symptoms of this disease are classified into two types - motor and non-motor symptoms. Some of the motor symptoms are instability in posture, bradykinesia, tremor, etc while on the other hand, the non-motor symptoms are changes in body odor, sleep disorders, difficulty in swallowing and depression. The intensity of these symptoms differs from person to person. Amongst these two types of symptoms, non-motor symptoms are identifiable at an early stage. Hence detection of these symptoms helps in recognizing whether a person has Parkinson's Disease at an early stage. Patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease give out a distinguishable musky smell. The paper describes a non-intrusive and definite method for detecting Parkinson's disease through an individual's smell signatures. VOC sensors which determine the components in sweat were used to achieve this objective. The sensors were interfaced with Arduino UNO, which in turn gave the values of the different components of sweat in the Arduino programming software. The values of the various components of sweat obtained from people with Parkinson's Disease and healthy individuals is compared. This comparison is used to determine whether that person is suffering from the disease.

Hao,2021,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,Parkinson's disease;Wearable sensor system;Machine learning;Multi-level fusion;Multi-symptom assessment.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the heterogeneity of early PD leads to inter-rater and intra-rater variability in observation-based clinical assessment. Thus, objective monitoring of PD-induced motor abnormalities has attracted significant attention to manage disease progression. Here, we proposed a hierarchical architecture to reliably detect abnormal characteristics and comprehensively quantify the multi-symptom severity in patients with PD. A novel wearable device was designed to measure motor features in fifteen PD patients and fifteen age-matched healthy subjects, while performing five types of motor tasks. The abnormality classes of multi-modal measurements were recognized by hidden Markov models (HMMs) in the first layer of the proposed architecture, aiming at motivating the evaluation of specific motor manifestations. Subsequently, in the second layer, three single-symptom models differentiated PD motor characteristics from normal motion patterns and quantified the severity of cardinal PD symptoms in parallel. In order to further analyze the disease status, the multi-level severity quantification was fused in the third layer, where machine learning algorithms were adopted to develop a multi-symptom severity score. Experimental results demonstrated that the quantification of three cardinal symptoms were highly accurate to distinguish PD patients from healthy controls. Furthermore, strong correlations were observed between the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and the predicted sub-scores for tremor (R=0.75, P=1.40e-3), bradykinesia (R=0.71, P=2.80e-3) and coordination impairments (R=0.69, P=4.20e-3), and the correlation coefficient can be enhanced to 0.88 (P=1.26e-5) based on the fusion schemes.

Classification and clinical score prediction are performed jointly to facilitate early PD diagnosis. Specifically, the proposed approach performs united embedding and sparse regression, which can determine the similarity matrices and discriminative features adaptively. Meanwhile, we constrain the similarity matrix among subjects and exploit the l2,p norm to conduct sparse adaptive control for obtaining the intrinsic information of the multimodal data structure. An effective iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem.

Selection of Appropriate Statistical Features of EEG Signals for Detection of Parkinson's Disease,R. Haloi; J. Hazarika; D. Chanda,2020,2020 International Conference on Computational Performance Evaluation (ComPE),Neurological disorder;EEG;Parkinsons disease;statistical features,"Analysis of signal transmission activities of human brain can give fruitful information about its functions. These information are of very importance in detection and diagnosis of different types of neurological disorders. Besides low spatial sensitivity, Electroencephalogram(EEG) signals are used for functional analysis of activities of brain because of the large temporal resolution of it. Identification of an appropriate feature of the EEG used to have a key role for its analysis. This work specifically describes feature extraction of EEG signals of persons with Parkinson's Disease(PD) by using statistical methods. Mean, standard deviation, energy, kurtosis and skewness are the five statistical features selected for this work. In addition to the extraction of features, comparative analysis of these features are also provided considering the EEGs of both normal (Non PD) and the persons with PD symptoms by using T-test. With the use of T-test, without the application of any classification techniques, the features of any two classes can be well differentiated. In the proposed approach, the results show that the p-assessment of the T-experiment is less than 0.05 and hence it can be considered that the features of the two classes are having less than 5% similarity. This fulfils the objective of detecting PD most efficiently. Out of the five features considered, Mean and Energy are the features, which are capable of differentiating the two categories of the subjects most significantly.",,,Diagnosis,Neurodegenation,BioPotential,,,,compe49325.2020.9200194,IEEE Conferences,

Since up to 90% of PD patients exhibit speech aberrations, however, the use of patient voice as a rapid diagnostic measure has shown significant promise. Past research towards creating voice-based automated diagnostic tools has relied on expert handcrafted audio feature sets that capture patient articulation, phonation, and prosody properties. Not only is there a limited consensus on the ideal contents of a PD audio diagnostic feature set, but also manually selected features may not fully exploit the predictive power of the underlying data. In this study, we demonstrate the benefit of employing VGGish embeddings, a more generalizable and higher throughput feature extraction strategy, for voice-based PD diagnosis. Our top VGGish-based model achieved 87% accuracy for detecting PD and significantly outperformed models trained on multiple handcrafted feature sets, a mel-frequency cepstral coefficient set, as well as an ImageNet pretrained convolutional neural network extraction strategy. VGGish models were also highly competitive with clinically determined UPDRS III-18 speech deterioration ratings for PD diagnosis.

Utilized data to extract the temporal shapes of the gait cycle are based on changing vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF), measured by 16 sensors placed in the soles of shoes worn by each subject. To reduce the number of data dimensions, the sequences of corresponding sensors placed in different feet are combined by subtraction. This method analyzes the temporal pattern of time-series collected from different sensors, without extracting special features representing statistics of different parts of the gait cycle.

However, it has been observed that PD's presence in a human is related to its hand-writing as well as hand-drawn subjects. From that perspective, several techniques have been proposed by researchers to detect Parkinson's disease from hand-drawn images of suspected people. But, the previous methods have their constraints.

Early symptoms such as muscle stiffness, tremors, impaired balance and difficulty with walking are considerably less noticeable. Blood tests and Scans also do not provide sufficient evidence for early diagnosis. Hence it is very difficult for doctors to diagnose the onset of Parkinson's Disease. However, smearing of speech gives an early warning and can be effectively used for the prediction of PD. This paper, the voice recording samples of Parkinson's disease affected and healthy patients have been used for PD prediction. Thirteen predictive models using various Machine Learning techniques have been formulated using the University of California, Irvine (UCI) dataset. A comparative study of these predictive models has been carried out on the UCI dataset consisting of biomedical voice recording samples of healthy and Parkinson's Disease affected peoples. These predictive models have been trained and tested for their accuracy and efficiency. The performance analysis of the best five models has been presented in this paper, for accurate prediction of Parkinson's Disease at an early stage.

Song,2020,IEEE Access,Parkinson disease;classification;deep features;speech signals;transfer learning,"Parkinson's disease is a neural degenerative disease. It slowly progresses from mild to severe stage, resulting in the degeneration of dopamine cells of neurons. Due to the deficiency of dopamine cells in the brain, it leads to a motor (tremor, slowness, impaired posture) and non-motor (speech, olfactory) defects in the body. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is a difficult chore as the symptoms of disease appear overtime. However, different diagnostic systems have contributed towards disease detection by considering gait, tremor and speech characteristics. Recent work has shown that speech impairments can be considered as a possible predictor for Parkinson's disease classification and remains an open research area. The speech signals show major differences and variations for Parkinson patients as compared to normal human beings. Therefore, variation in speech should be modeled using acoustic features to identify these variations. In this research, we propose three methodsthe first method employs a transfer learning-based approach using spectrograms of speech recordings, the second method evaluates deep features extracted from speech spectrograms using machine learning classifiers and the third method evaluates simple acoustic feature of recordings using machine learning classifiers. The proposed frameworks are evaluated on a Spanish dataset pc-Gita. The results show that the second framework shows promising results with deep features. The highest 99.7% accuracy on vowel \o\ and read text is observed using a multilayer perceptron. Whereas 99.1% accuracy observed on vowel \i\ deep features using random forest.

In this context, ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithms like boosting algorithms can play a significant role in detecting Parkinson's Disease at an early stage. In this paper, four boosting algorithms are studied and implemented in UCI Parkinson's Disease dataset. After rigorous simulation, the ML models exhibited satisfactory results in terms of different performance parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score., AUC, Youden, specificity and error rate. However, the performances of the model are improved by tuning the hyperparameters with GridSearchCV. Hence, a detailed comparative analysis is portrayed where Light GBM displayed the highest accuracy of 93.39% after hyperparameter tuning. However, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting algorithm also depicted accuracies more than 90% but AdaBoost demonstrated maximum 87.22% accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,icievicivpr52578.2021.9564108,IEEE Conferences,
Detection of voice impairment for parkinson's disease using machine learning tools,R. Laila; L. Salwa; R. Mohammed,2021,"2020 10th International Symposium on Signal, Image, Video and Communications (ISIVC)",Parkinson's disease;speech processing;machine learning;feature extraction;feature selection,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement, and patients need periodic monitoring which is difficult for them and costs a lot. In recent years, there has been much research about the link between Parkinson's disease (PD) and speech impairment in order to provide an early diagnosis of the disease and create a system for remote monitoring of patients as well. Many studies have used signal and speech processing techniques to convert acoustic signals into vectors of features which are then mapped into different machine learning algorithms. The results obtained in PD telemedicine studies have shown that the choice of feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms directly influence the accuracy and reliability of the proposed system. This article provides a system to assess the speech disorders in the context of PD using features extracted from three domains (time/frequency, cepstral, and wavelet domain) and machine learning tools. Our goal is to assess the ability of each individual to distinguish those with Parkinson's disease from healthy people. The results suggest that cepstral domain gives the most reliable parametrization comparable to time/frequency and wavelet domain with a high accuracy using Support Vector Machine classifier.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,isivc49222.2021.9487544,IEEE Conferences,

Anzar,2021,"2021 Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics, Signals & Systems (ICMSS)",K-Nearest Neighbourhood;Parkinson's disease;Principal Component Analysis;Random Forest;Vocal features,"Parkinson&#x0027;s disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the human central nervous system that causes tremors and affects movement. Symptoms usually appear gradually over time. Researchers are seeking biomarkers for Parkinson&#x0027;s disease in the hopes of allowing for earlier detection and more tailored treatments to slow the disease&#x0027;s progression. Existing methods of diagnosis include Blood tests, MRI scans, and PET scans. However, these are highly time and resource-consuming. PD also shows an amble change in the voice patterns of a person. Hence, acoustic analysis of voice signals can indicate the progression of PD. This can be analysed using a trained classifier model, which provides an easy diagnosis of the disease. This paper analyses the performance of AI-ML models viz- Linear regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbourhood (KNN), Ran-dom Forest, and XG Boost for the detection of Parkinson&#x0027;s disease using vocal feature sets. Experimental evaluations show that the Random Forest model produced an impressive accuracy of 100&#x0025;. The classification algorithms&#x0027; accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are all examined. The Random Forest classifiers are 100&#x0025; accurate, with an accuracy of 1.000, recall of 1.000, F1-score of 1.000, and MCC of 1.000. Implementing dimensionality reduction using the Eigen approach (Principal Component Analysis) and the dataset combination are the critical reasons for the reported high accuracy.

Lu,2020,IEEE Access,Adaptive grey wolf optimization;deep learning;feature extraction;healthcare;Parkinson's disease;sparse autoencoders;vocal feature vectors,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the motor system of the body. The progression rate is very slow but, as the condition worsens it stimulates the non-motor characteristics, especially mood disorders, hallucinations, delusions, and other observable cognitive changes. Genetic and environmental factors greatly influence the risk of Parkinson's development. The early diagnosis of PD improves the condition through proper treatment. During the initial stage of PD, vocal impairments become more common among the affected individuals. Advanced studies on vocal disorders give more assistance for precise PD detection. In this paper, the vocal features of PD affected individuals are analyzed with sophisticated computational models. Initially, the samples are pre-processed, as it contains more missing values. Then the predictor candidate subset is identified from the processed vocal features using the Adaptive Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm, a meta-heuristic global search optimization technique. Furthermore, the latent representation of the candidate features is extracted through sparse autoencoders for effective discrimination between the PD affected and control cases. For classification, six supervised machine learning algorithms were employed. The proposed model is trained with the data, divided through 10-fold cross-validation scheme and the performance is evaluated based on validation metrics. The PD dataset is accessed from University of California (UCI), Irvine Machine Learning repository to conduct the experimental analysis.

Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic.

Acharya,2021,IEEE Sensors Journal,Parkinson's disease;electroencephalography;smoothed pseudo Wigner Ville distribution;convolutional neural network;classification,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative ailment which causes changes in the neuronal, behavioral, and physiological structures. During the early stages of PD, these changes are very subtle and hence accurate diagnosis is challenging. Pathological and neurological experts assess the PD patients by examining their drawing, writing, walking, tremor, facial expressions, and speech. The manual analysis performed by specialists is time-consuming and prone to errors. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals represent changes in the brain activities, but it is difficult to manually analyze these signals due to their non-linear, non-stationary, and complex nature. Traditional machine learning methods require several manual steps, such as decomposition, extraction of features, and classification. To overcome these limitations, automated PD detection using smoothed pseudo-Wigner Ville distribution (SPWVD) coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNN) called Parkinson's disease CNN (PDCNNet) is proposed. First the EEG signals are subjected to SPWVD to obtain time-frequency representation (TFR). Then these two-dimensional plots are fed to an CNN. The proposed model is developed using two public databases. We have obtained an accuracy of 100% and 99.97% for dataset 1 and 2, respectively in detecting PD automatically using our proposed PDCNNet model.

Purpose-built devices have been developed that record various signals which can be associated with average PD symptom severity, as quantified on standard clinical metrics such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Speech signals are particularly promising in this regard, because they can be easily recorded without the use of expensive, dedicated hardware. Previous studies have demonstrated replication of UPDRS to within less than 2 points of a clinical raters' assessment of symptom severity, using high-quality speech signals collected using dedicated telemonitoring hardware. Here, we investigate the potential of using the standard voice-over-GSM (2G) or UMTS (3G) cellular mobile telephone networks for PD telemonitoring, networks that, together, have greater than 5 billion subscribers worldwide. We test the robustness of this approach using a simulated noisy mobile communication network over which speech signals are transmitted, and approximately 6000 recordings from 42 PD subjects. We show that UPDRS can be estimated to within less than 3.5 points difference from the clinical raters' assessment, which is clinically useful given that the inter-rater variability for UPDRS can be as high as 4-5 UPDRS points.

In this way, wearable devices can be used to assist doctors' treatment and improve their work efficiency. Seventeen PD patients wearing detection devices completed the standard movements stipulated in Part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for examining resting and postural tremors (RTs and PTs), during which the acceleration signals (ASs) of the patients' movements were collected. The AS and DS are denoised by using the designed wavelet automatic filtering process. A sliding window is used to select the most obvious period of tremor during detection. Then extract the characteristic values from time domain, frequency domain and spectral domain respectively, and explore the most suitable model method for this study. In terms of reflecting the physical characteristics of tremors, the AS and DS eigenvalue sets each had their own advantages. For the RTs, there were stronger correlations between the AS eigenvalue set and doctors' scores. The average correlation coefficients (rs) of the AS and DS eigenvalue sets were 0.798 (0.630-0.895, at the 95% confidence interval) and 0.731 (0.522-0.857, at the 95% confidence interval), respectively.

Quantifying this behavior using the time-scale multi-resolution analysis provides valuable information to the prediction of fall risk in Parkinson&#x0027;s disease patients. In this paper, multifractal spectrum measures, as complexity or smoothness measures of signal, were used to classify faller Parkinson&#x0027;s disease patients from the non-fallers. From data previously gathered, in 11 faller PD participants and 49 non-fallers, the center of pressure signal was recorded on a rigid and foam surface with open and closed eyes. Multifractal spectrum (MFS) measures were calculated using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Based on MFS measures, several classification algorithms including decision trees, naive Bayes, logistic regression, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) were tested searching for the best one. With the aim of better classification performance, stratified cross-validation, as a sample balancing method, and ensemble methods such as Bagging and Adaboost were applied. Results showed the most prevalent smooth behavior in MFS (<tex>$a_{0}$</tex>) on the rigid surface can separate the faller PD participants effectively.

However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones. For classification we use Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning network and compare the results with traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic regression, KNN and Ensemble bagged tree. For experimental validation we use the Oxford Parkinson disease dataset with 195 data samples, which we have augmented with 571 synthetic data samples. The results for BiLSTM shows that even with a holdout of 90%, the model was still able to effectively recognize PD with an average accuracy for ten rounds experiment using 22 features as 82.86%, 97.1%, and 96.37% for original, augmented (Spline) and augmented (Pchip) datasets, respectively.

Classification-based screening of Parkinson's disease patients through voice signal,F. Cordella; A. Paffi; A. Pallotti,2021,2021 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA),Parkinson's Disease;Speech Analysis;Telemonitoring;Classification,"In this paper a classification algorithm for Parkinson's Disease screening is proposed. Code executes the processing of specific voice signals recorded by healthy and ill subjects. In the direction of a future implementation and validation in a home telemonitoring system, the algorithm has been built with the objective to serve as a screening tool for the precocious directing of subjects with high risk of neurological diseases to instrumental exams. In fact, in several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, motor impairments of vocal apparatus arise earlier than postural and ambulatory symptoms. In a home telemonitoring system, in which hardware would consist in a voice recorder (that could be a simple smartphone) and a server for the web platform, data would be acquired and instantly stored on a platform for their processing through machine learning algorithms and to be viewed by specialists. For this purpose, a fully automatic process is needed. Therefore, in this work, audio-preprocessing and features computation are completely performed automatically, using Matlab. Final models have been trained in Matlab environments from Weka's libraries. The family of developed models are trained with different type of phonations, from simple vowels to complex sounds, for a wider and more efficient analysis of vocal apparatus motor impairments. Moreover, dataset was 612 observation large, that is significantly above the mean size of similar works using simple phonations only. For a deeper analysis, different groups of parameters have been tested and cepstral features have been found to be optimal for classification and made up the big part of final algorithm. Developed models are part of the K-Nearest Neighbor family, thus, available for implementation in web platform. Finally, obtained models have shown high accuracies on the whole dataset, reaching values comparable with the literature but with more stability (standard deviation less than 1%). These results have been confirmed in the last validation session in which models have been exported and validated with 25% of data, reaching a best performance with a true positive rate of 98% and a true negative rate of 87%.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,memea52024.2021.9478683,IEEE Conferences,

Wearable sensors have been demonstrated to help overcoming such a difficulty, by providing objective measures of motor abnormalities. However, up to now, those sensors have been used on advanced PD patients with evident motor impairment. As a novelty, here we report the impact of wearable sensors in the evaluation of motor abnormalities in newly diagnosed, untreated, namely de novo, patients. Methods: A network of wearable sensors was used to measure motor capabilities, in 30 de novo PD patients and 30 healthy subjects, while performing five motor tasks. Measurement data were used to determine motor features useful to highlight impairments and were compared with the corresponding clinical scores. Three classifiers were used to differentiate PD from healthy subjects. Results: Motor features gathered from wearable sensors showed a high degree of significance in discriminating the early untreated de novo PD patients from the healthy subjects, with 95% accuracy. The rates of severity obtained from the measured features are partially in agreement with the clinical scores, with some highlighted, though justified, exceptions. Conclusion: Our findings support the feasibility of adopting wearable sensors in the detection of motor anomalies in early, untreated, PD patients. Significance: This work demonstrates that subtle motor impairments, occurring in de novo patients, can be evidenced by means of wearable sensors, providing clinicians with instrumental tools as suitable supports for early diagnosis, and subsequent management.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Wearable,,,,jbhi.2019.2903627,IEEE Journals,

In this study, we implemented a novel gait evaluating approach to provide not only a binary classification of PD gaits and normal walking, but also a quantification of the PD gaits to relate them to the PD severity level. The proposed system is a dual-modal deep-learning-based model, where left and right gait is modeled separately by a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by an attention-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The left and right samples for model training and testing were segmented sequentially from multiple 1D vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) signals according to the detected gait cycle. Experimental results indicate that our model can provide state-of-the-art performance in terms of classification accuracy.

Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is used to interpret the models' output and provide insight into which features in the spatiotemporal gait GRF signals are most significant for the models' predictions. This allows their assignment to gait events, implying that while for the classification of healthy gait the heel strike and body balance are the most indicative gait elements, foot landing and body balance are those most affected in advanced stages of PD.

Motivated by this observation, we propose to apply Bidirectional long-short term memory (LSTM) model to capture time-series dynamic features of a speech signal for detecting PD. The dynamic speech features are measured based on computing the energy content in the transition from unvoiced to voiced segments (onset), and in the transition from voiced to unvoiced segments (offset).

Recently, the construct of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), originally conceptualized to identify the pre-dementia state in Alzheimer Disease, has been employed in PD to describe a frame of cognitive decline without impaired functional activity. The aim of this study was to differentiate PD patients with and without MCI using quantitative gait variables through a machine learning approach. Thus, 45 PD patients underwent gait analysis and spatial-temporal parameters were acquired in three different conditions (normal gait, motor dual-task and cognitive dual-task). While the demographic and clinical features of PD patients with and without MCI were compared through a statistical analysis, the features of each gait condition were given as input to decision tree (DT), random forests (RF) and k nearest neighbour (KNN) to detect the presence of MCI. Then, some evaluation metrics were computed. DT achieved the highest accuracy (86.8%) using motor dual-task features, and the best sensitivity (88.2%), using gait task features as well as KNN (88.2% of sensitivity). KNN obtained the highest AUCROC (0.900) with the cognitive dual-task. DT with motor and cognitive dual-tasks and KNN with cognitive dual-task achieved the highest sensitivity (85.3%).

A statistical analysis was performed on clinical, demographical and on the spatial and temporal parameters in order to find any difference between PD patients with and without FoG; the last one obtained no statistically significant results. Thus, a machine learning analysis was implemented employing tree-based algorithms (decision tree, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Tree, Ada-Boosting of a decision tree) and using as input the spatial and temporal features of gait. The results were promising since accuracy, specificity and sensitivity overcame 90%, reaching also 100% of sensitivity in some cases. The best algorithms were Gradient Boosted Tree and the Ada-Boosting of a decision tree while Random Forests and decision tree obtained lower results.

The aim of this study was to develop data-driven methods and test their clinimetric properties to detect and quantify PD motor states using motion sensor data from leg agility tests. Nineteen PD patients were recruited in a levodopa single dose challenge study. PD patients performed leg agility tasks while wearing motion sensors on their lower extremities. Clinical evaluation of video recordings was performed by three Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia specialists who used four items from the motor section of the unified PD rating scale (UPDRS), the treatment response scale (TRS) and a dyskinesia score. Using the sensor data, spatiotemporal features were calculated and relevant features were selected by feature selection. Machine learning methods like support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and linear regression, using ten-fold cross validation were trained to predict motor states of the patients. SVM showed the best convergence validity with correlation coefficients of 0.81 to TRS, 0.83 to UPDRS #31 (body bradykinesia and hypokinesia), 0.78 to SUMUPDRS (the sum of the UPDRS items: #26-leg agility, #27-arising from chair, and #29-gait), and 0.67 to dyskinesia. Additionally, the SVM-based scores had similar test-retest reliability in relation to clinical ratings. The SVM-based scores were less responsive to treatment effects than the clinical scores, particularly with regards to dyskinesia.

The human body can be divided into six widely accepted parts (head, trunk and four limbs), which are interrelated and interact with each other. Therefore, in this study we attempted to investigate how the major joints of one body part move with the ones in another body part, namely multivariate AJMD. For method illustration, the motion data of sit-to-stand-to-sit for healthy participants and people with Parkinson disease (PD) were employed. Four types of multivariate AJMD were investigated by eigenspace-maximal-information-canonical-correlation-analysis, which obtained maximal- information-eigen-coefficients (MIECes), the parameters for quantifying the correlation between two sets of joints located in two different body parts. The results show that healthy participants have significantly higher MIECes than the PD patients (p-value <; 0.0001).

A Novel Diagnosis System Using Regularized Encoder-Decoder Based Generative Probabilistic Network for Parkinson's Disease,Y. Sarker; M. N. Islam Mondal; S. R. Fahim; S. Shahriar; S. K. Sarker; S. K. Das,2020,2020 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP),Parkinson's disease subject;Artificial neural network;Deep belief network and Regularized encoder-decoder,"This paper presents a novel way to address the classification problem of Parkinsons disease (PD) using the regularized encoder-decoder based generative probabilistic network. The progressive nervous system disorder, called PD, affected people continuously suffers low moving speed due to appear in motor disturbances. Additionally, decrease the arms swinging while walking, postural instability, and huffing gaits also appear for PD patients. In line with these problems, identifying PD has become one of the most challenging tasks in the medical sector. In this paper, a deep learning architecture is proposed to classify the PD patient with a detailed comparative analysis. The proposed model can not only optimize medical decisions but also reduce financial costs. The proposed network comprises an unsupervised encoder-decoder representation learning process for extracting the efficient feature that enables the unsupervised generative model to learn the probability distribution over the encoded representation. Finally, an artificial neural network is considered to perform the classification task. The experiment is conducted on 188 people where 107 people are affected with PD. Results show that the proposed model can achieve 93.1% accuracy that confirms high performance as compared to others.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,tensymp50017.2020.9230792,IEEE Conferences,

Given that speech is affected by PD, the combination of deep neural networks and speech processing can provide automatic detection schemes. Accordingly, in this study we analyze for the first time a new state-of-the-art speaker recognition technique, x-Vectors, in a different scenario: the automatic detection of PD from speech. The proposed approach is compared with another speaker recognition technique, i-Vectors, employed in previous works and used as baseline in this study. A corpus with 43 PD patients and 46 control speakers was used to evaluate the performance of these two techniques at two sampling frequencies: 8 and 16 kHz.The x-Vector approach provided the best results in terms of accuracy and AUC reaching values of 90% and 0.94, respectively.

Prediction of Freezing of Gait in Patients With Parkinson's Disease by Identifying Impaired Gait Patterns,Y. Zhang; W. Yan; Y. Yao; J. B. Ahmed; Y. Tan; D. Gu,2020,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,Accelerometer;freezing of gait prediction;gait impairment;machine learning;Parkinson's disease,"Freezing of gait (FoG) prediction, combined with rhythmic laser cues, may help Parkinson's disease (PD) patients overcome FoG episodes. This study aimed to utilize the impaired gait patterns preceding FoG to build a machine-learning-based model for FoG prediction. Acceleration signals were collected using an accelerometer attached to the lower back of 12 PD patients with FoG while they were performing designed FoG-provoking walking tasks. Step-based impaired gait features and conventional FoG detection features were extracted from the signals, based on which two FoG prediction models were built using AdaBoost to validate if the use of the impaired gait features can better predict FoG. For the correct labeling of the gait prior to FoG (pre-FoG), the personalized pre-FoG phase was defined according to the slope of the impaired gait pattern. The impaired gait features were relabeled based on the pre-FoG phase upon which the personalized labeled FoG prediction model was built. This was compared with the model built using unified labeling. Results showed that impaired gait features could better predict FoG than conventional FoG detection features with low time latency, and personalized labeling could further improve the FoG prediction accuracy. Using impaired gait features and personalized labeling, we built a FoG prediction model with 0.93 sec of latency. Compared to using conventional features and unified labeling, our model achieved 5.7% higher accuracy (82.7%) in patient-dependent test and 9.8% higher accuracy (77.9%) in patient-independent test. Therefore, using the impaired gait patterns is a promising approach to accurately predict FoG with low latency.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,,,tnsre.2020.2969649,IEEE Journals,

Tsanas,2021,IEEE Access,Digital biomarkers;Parkinson's disease;REM sleep behavior disorder;speech analysis;statistical learning;smartphones;telemedicine,"Speech impairment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) has been extensively studied. Our understanding of speech in people who are at an increased risk of developing PD is, however, rather limited. It is known that isolated Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is associated with a high risk of developing PD. The aim of this study is to investigate smartphone speech testing to: (1) distinguish participants with RBD from controls and PD, and (2) predict a range of self- or researcher-administered clinical scores that quantify participants' motor symptoms, cognition, daytime sleepiness, depression, and the overall state of health. The rationale of our analyses is to test an initial hypothesis that speech can be used to detect and quantify the symptoms associated with RBD and PD. We analyzed 4242 smartphone voice recordings collected in clinic and at home from 92 Controls, 112 RBD and 335 PD participants. We used acoustic signal analysis and machine learning, employing 337 features that quantify different properties of speech impairment. Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme, we were able to distinguish RBD from controls (sensitivity 60.7%, specificity 69.6%) and RBD from PD participants (sensitivity 74.9%, specificity 73.2%), and predict clinical assessments with clinically useful accuracy. These promising findings warrant further investigation in using speech as a digital biomarker for PD and RBD to facilitate intervention in the early and prodromal stages of PD.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Smartphone,,,,access.2021.3057715,IEEE Journals,
The Detection of Parkinson's Disease From Speech Using Voice Source Information,N. P. Narendra; B. Schuller; P. Alku,2021,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",Parkinson's disease;glottal features;glottal source estimation;support vector machines;end-to-end systems,"Developing automatic methods to detect Parkinson's disease (PD) from speech has attracted increasing interest as these techniques can potentially be used in telemonitoring health applications. This article studies the utilization of voice source information in the detection of PD using two classifier architectures: traditional pipeline approach and end-to-end approach. The former consists of feature extraction and classifier stages. In feature extraction, the baseline acoustic features-consisting of articulation, phonation, and prosody features-were computed and voice source information was extracted using glottal features that were estimated by iterative adaptive inverse filtering (IAIF) and quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering methods. Support vector machine classifiers were developed utilizing the baseline and glottal features extracted from every speech utterance and the corresponding healthy/PD labels. The end-to-end approach uses deep learning models which were trained using both raw speech waveforms and raw voice source waveforms. In the latter, two glottal inverse filtering methods (IAIF and QCP) and zero frequency filtering method were utilized. The deep learning architecture consists of a combination of convolutional layers followed by a multilayer perceptron. Experiments were performed using PC-GITA speech database. From the traditional pipeline systems, the highest classification accuracy (67.93%) was given by combination of baseline and QCP-based glottal features. From the end-to-end-systems, the highest accuracy (68.56%) was given by the system trained using QCP-based glottal flow signals. Even though classification accuracies were modest for all systems, the study is encouraging as the extraction of voice source information was found to be most effective in both approaches.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,taslp.2021.3078364,IEEE Journals,

Very few researches attempted to identify the emotion impairment in PD through EEG signals. The main objective of this work is to classify the emotions perceived by the PD subjects through audio-visual stimuli using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG database of 20 subjects on PD and 20 NC is developed using a 14 channel wireless EEG device at a sampling frequency of 128 Hz. Audiovisual stimuli of six emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust) are used to induce the emotions. The acquired EEG signals are pre-processed using the IIR Butterworth filter to remove the noises, artifacts, and interferences in EEG signals and used to derive three frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) of EEG data. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is used to extract the two most significant features (Maximum Line Length, Maximum Vertical Line Length) from Recurrence Plot (RP). Besides, these features are combined together called ALL features. Therefore, three types of features were tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) to test its significance in classifying emotions in PD and NC and a five-fold cross-validation method is used to split the features into training and testing set. Finally, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier with two different types of kernel functions used to classify the emotions of PD and NC. The maximum mean accuracy of 89.17%, 84.50% is achieved on NC and PD, respectively. The maximum individual class accuracy of NC/PD is sadness - 90.90/87.50, happiness - 91.10/84.30, fear- 88/84.10, disgust - 88.5/82.70, surprise - 87.4/84.60, and anger - 89.10/83.80. Experimental results indicate that RQA features are highly useful in detecting the emotions in PD compared to other methods and ELM gives the highest mean accuracy compared to other works in the literature.",,,Diagnosis,Neurodegenation,BioPotential,,,,cspa48992.2020.9068709,IEEE Conferences,

Opal System by APDM is a commercial device used to perform gait analysis with inertial measurements units (IMUs). In this study we evaluate repeatability of spatio-temporal gait measurements, assessed with Opal Instrumented Stand and Walk (ISAW) test on a cohort of forty-five Parkinsonian patients. Repeatability is assessed by means of Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Repeatability Limit (RL) for each variable. RL is then compared to the absolute value of difference (DoM) of PD patients' measurements mean and normative mean of the same variable, in order to understand which variable can better characterize Parkinsonian gait with respect to normal gait.

Early detection of this disease remains a challenging task. Recently, vocal and speech data are widely used to detect this disease. In this study, we proposed two classification schemes for improving the identification accuracy of PD cases from voice measurements. First, we applied a variable adaptive moment-based backpropagation algorithm of ANN called BPVAM. Then, we investigated the combination of dimensionality reduction method using principal component analysis (PCA) with BPVAM for classification of the same dataset. The main objective was improving the prediction of PD in the early stages by increasing the sensitivity of the system to dealing with data in its fine detail. In experiments, it was proved that robustness of the system was improved by including features with largest variances using PCA which helped the model to learn the patterns earlier in the training process. Results indicated that BPVAM-PCA was relatively more effective than BPVAM. In addition, these methods were also compared with some other well-known algorithms.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,icdabi51230.2020.9325709,IEEE Conferences,

Classification performance is examined for three different tasks, namely, Spontaneous speech (SPON), Diadochokinetic rate (DIDK) and Sustained phoneme production (PHON). Experiments are conducted using speech data recorded from 60 ALS, 60 PD, and 60 HC subjects. Classifications using SVM and DNN are considered as baseline schemes. Classification accuracy of ALS and HC (indicated by ALS/HC) using CNN-LSTM has shown an improvement of 10.40%, 4.22% and 0.08% for PHON, SPON and DIDK tasks, respectively over the best of the baseline schemes. Furthermore, the CNN-LSTM network achieves the highest PD/HC classification accuracy of 88.5% for the SPON task and the highest 3-class (ALS/PD/HC) classification accuracy of 85.24% for the DIDK task. Experiments using transfer learning at low resource training data show that data from ALS benefits PD/HC classification and vice-versa.

Video data was collected from 89 subjects at a medical center and labeled by doctors. We first demonstrate classification between the healthy subjects and subjects with PD suspected case followed by the classification between the subjects with true PD and the subjects with essential tremor.

Three artificially enlarged samples of subjects were created: a sample of patients with PD, a sample of patients with ET, and a sample of control subjects. When constructing models, two problems arise: the problem of inadequacy and the problem of insufficient generalizing ability of the model. Both of these issues must be considered when building models. The paper proposes models that, according to the authors, are promising for the early and differential diagnosis of PD and ET.

A Study of Deep Learning for Predicting Freeze of Gait in Patients with Parkinson's Disease,A. M. Yuan; S. Chakraborty,2020,2020 19th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA),Freeze of gait;Parkinson's disease;deep learning;predicting freeze of gait,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a gait impairment, common in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Predicting FOG before its onset enables preemptive cueing that can prevent FOG or reduce its intensity and duration. Deep learning models have recently been proposed to predict FOG. Such models have feature learning capabilities and do not require the use of hand-crafted features. However, some intricacies that are specific to this approach have not been carefully studied. In particular, the implication of the lack of accurately labelled pre-FOG data, which can have a significant impact on model development and evaluation, has not been fully understood.In this work, we discuss the challenges in deep learning for predicting FOG, illustrate the impact of the lack of accurate pre-FOG data on model development and evaluation, and present a more reliable evaluation method that is independent of the labelling of pre-FOG data. Using this new evaluation method, we study the deep learning schemes for FOG prediction by performing extensive experiments on a public domain dataset. The main conclusions of the study include the following: 1) even without accurate pre-FOG data, deep learning techniques can achieve very high FOG prediction performance while not introducing significant false alarms; 2) traditional deep learning performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity may not be indicative of the FOG prediction performance; 3) human gait data have high subject-dependent variability, and it requires different deep learning models to achieve the best performance for different individuals; and finally 4) transfer learning is an effective technique for predicting FOG. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to derive these conclusions via extensive empirical analysis.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,,,icmla51294.2020.00207,IEEE Conferences,

The first clinical symptoms can manifest themselves long before the retirement age and inevitably lead to reducing the possibility of continuing work. However, PD is sometimes misdiagnosed. In this article, we discuss the typical misdiagnosed cases and propose a second opinion system based on wearable sensors and artificial intelligence. For this reason, we designed a number of common tasks and recorded the movement data using wearable sensors worn by individuals with PD and other extrapyramidal disorders. PD patients are differentiated against other patients with similar diseases and not against healthy subjects. This allows one to measure the true specificity of wearable technologies with regard to detecting PD. Data analysis and classification of the types of tremor using machine learning methods (feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, classification) helps significantly improve the accuracy of PD diagnosis. Our results show that, when considering bradykinesia and tremor together, the accuracy of distinguishing PD from similar diseases increases (f1 score 0.88). This closed-loop configuration makes it possible to tune exercises to maximize the diagnostic value of the entire routine.

This paper proposes a Spectrogram Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (S-DCGAN) for sample augmentation to overcome the limited amount of existing patient voiceprint datasets and samples. S-DCGAN generates a high-resolution spectrogram by increasing network layers, adding the Spectral Normalization (SN) method, and combining feature matching strategy. The high-similarity and low-distortion spectrogram are selected in light of Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) values and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) to augment the samples. FrÃƒÂ©chet Inception Distance (FID) and GAN-train result show the generalization ability of the generated data. We construct the ResNet50 model with a Global Average Pooling(GAP) layer to extract the voiceprint features and classify them effectively to improve recognition accuracy. The GAP suppresses the over-fitting problem and optimizes quickly. Finally, on the Sakar dataset, comparative experiments were conducted on different models and classification methods. Results show that the S-DCGAN-ResNet50 hybrid model can achieve the highest voiceprint recognition accuracy of 91.25% and specificity of 92.5%, which can distinguish between PD patients and healthy people more precisely compared with DCGAN-ResNet50.

Existing quantification methods of PD-related symptoms are largely subjective and rater-dependent, warranting the development of objective device-based assessments. This study introduces a sensitive computerized system of two LEAP Motion Controllers (LMCs) that can be used to quantify neuromotor symptoms in PD patients. The accuracy of the system was evaluated using a series of clinically relevant hand motion tasks, which included finger tapping, hand movements, and pronation/supination. By capturing hand motion from multiple angles, the dual system of LMCs recognizes a broader range of hand positions, therefore increasing data specificity as well as preventing data loss due to line-of-sight obstructions. The use of multi-threading contributed to a high sampling rate of 60 Hz, which allows a complete reconstruction of high-frequency signals essential for recognizing the fast motions associated with postural tremor. Finally, to make the application of the dual system more easily accessible to both patients and clinicians, we developed a GUI and 3D data visualization kit. The dual system of LMCs, which is characterized by precision, objectivity, and ease of use, can become a useful supplement in intraoperative and clinical testing and treatment of PD.",,,Diagnosis,Limb movements,Other,,,,bibe50027.2020.00140,IEEE Conferences,

In this paper, gait parameters are collected from 200 PD patients and 100 healthy controls (HC) through the wearable sensors, which include 95 features. Considering the redundancy between the features, F -test and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) methods are utilized for feature selection. Moreover, support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is utilized to train the classifier, which can automatically classify PD patients and HC. Furthermore, experiments on the class-imbalance and class-equilibrium samples are performed to verify the reliability and stability of the above methods.

Early detection with a proper customized rehabilitation program can slow the disease's progression and extend their independent living. Furthermore, the objective and real-time monitoring of gait patterns is also important as it can be used to adjust treatment programs and follow up the clinical progress effectively. However, the assessment nowadays is typically depending on a subjective FOQ questionnaire. This paper proposes a low-cost wearable IMU sensor that integrates cloud computing technology to monitor and assess PD patients' gait. The device uses a single IMU sensor, which combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer, to record dynamic acceleration and perform gravity compensation.

The number of neurons also begins to die or become impaired with advancing age. These dying or impaired neurons result in declination for the generation of dopamine which is the prime reason for Parkinson&#x0027;s disease (PD).

Therefore, early detection of PD is particularly important for reducing complications. Currently, the diagnosis of PD is assessed by specialized physicians through the Uniform PD Rating Scale (UPDRS). This limits the detection rate of PD and the timely assessment of disease progression to a certain extent. Moreover, with the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning has been widely and effectively applied to the assessment and monitoring of PD. Therefore, we use machine learning to distinguish between healthy people and PD patients based on UPDRS. In this paper, we collaborated with the First People&#x2019;s Hospital of Yunnan Province to collect exercise data from 15 healthy individuals and 15 PD patients using wearable motion sensors.

Timing and morphology of sEMG signal are typically investigated, while poor information on frequency content is available. Thus, the present pilot study was designed to test the hypothesis that continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of sEMG signal is a suitable approach to assess muscle activity during PD-walking task, in both time and frequency domains. To this aim, sEMG signals from 4 leg muscles of 5 patients are acquired during walking and processed to assess CWT-scalogram function. Results show that CWT is able to provide time ranges of muscle-activation over the whole PD population, which matches with what reported in previous studies on PD. The novel contribution of this study consists in achieving a characterization of the frequency content of each one of regions detected in time domain. Although the frequency content does not exceed the typical frequency range between 5 Hz and 450 Hz, different mean frequency contents are observed among muscles and among different activations of the same muscle. In particular, a relevant variability of frequency content is observed for thigh muscles, showing differences up to 180 Hz between stance and swing values. In conclusion, present findings support the use of CWT scalogram for a reliable assessment of muscle activity in time-frequency domain, during walking of PD patients.

Clinicians assess the emotional impairment in PD using International standard questionnaires, and most of the time, this assessment becomes inaccurate since the verbal responses of PDs are not precise to express their internal feelings. EEG based emotional impairment detection in PD gained significant attention due to its robustness, flexibility, and non-invasiveness. In this work, we utilized the EEG dataset consists of 20 subjects each in PD and 20 Normal Control (NC), and EEG signals are collected using 14 channel wireless EEG device over six types of emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) at a sampling rate of 128 Hz. The 6<sup>th</sup> order IIR Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.5 Hz - 49 Hz is used to filter the noises and other external interferences. Two features from Recurrent Plot (RP) such as, Maximum Diagonal Line Length (MDLL) and Maximum Vertical Line Length (MVLL) are extracted from alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands of EEGs. These emotional relevant features are mapped into corresponding emotions of PD and NC using the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier. The gamma frequency band (30-49 Hz) feature of maximum diagonal line length gives a maximum mean accuracy of 91.38% and 87.55%, for NC, and PD subjects, respectively.",,,Diagnosis,Neurodegenation,BioPotential,,,,icccsp49186.2020.9315244,IEEE Conferences,

PD has no cure, and an impediment to developing a treatment is the lack of any accepted method to predict disease progression rate. The primary aim of this study was to develop a model using clinical measures and biomechanical measures of gait and postural stability to predict an individual's PD progression over two years. Data from 160 PD subjects were utilized. Machine learning models, including XGBoost and Feed Forward Neural Networks, were developed using extensive model optimization and cross-validation. The highest performing model was a neural network that used a group of clinical measures, achieved a PPV of 71% in identifying fast progressors, and explained a large portion (37%) of the variance in an individual's progression rate on held-out test data. This demonstrates the potential to predict individual PD progression rate and enrich trials by analyzing clinical and biomechanical measures with machine learning.",,,Diagnosis,Posture,Other,,,,icassp40776.2020.9054666,IEEE Conferences,

In this study, we analyzed the EEG features of different sub-bands associated with the MCI in the early-stage PD patients. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from 39 subjects during the resting state, including 17 early-state PD patients with MCI and 22 healthy control (HC) subjects. Welch's method was used to compute the power spectrum density at each EEG sub-band. It was shown that the alpha rhythm in PD patients was characterized by a higher relative power, while the beta and gamma rhythms exhibited lower relative powers as compared to the HC group. We applied the phase lag index (PLI) to quantify the phase synchronization of pair-wise channels at different sub-bands and then reconstructed the cross-band functional networks. We found that there were significantly different synchronization degrees in theta, alpha and beta bands between two groups. The phase synchronization between different regions of the whole brain in theta-alpha, alpha-delta, and beta-theta cross-band also showed significant abnormalities as compared to the HC group. The findings indicated that the abnormalities in EEG alpha, beta, and gamma activities occurred at the early stages of PD with MCI, and the power spectra and cross-band connectivity analysis may be a promising method to detect such abnormalities.",,,Diagnosis,Neurodegenation,BioPotential,,,,ccc50068.2020.9188888,IEEE Conferences,

Sejnowski,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),Multiple signal classification;Electroencephalography;Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world. PD is known to lead to marked alterations in cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia activity and subsequent movements, which may provide a biomarker for PD diagnosis. Delay differential analysis (DDA) is a time domain analysis framework based on embedding theory in nonlinear dynamics. An embedding reveals the nonlinear invariant properties of an unknown dynamical system (here the brain) from a single time series electroencephalography (EEG) or behavioral signals. The DDA models serve as a low-dimensional nonlinear functional basis onto which the data are mapped. The combination of behavioral and neurological observations gives rise to a multimodal analysis framework that could improve our understanding and classification of PD using time series data from physical systems. We demonstrate how 750 ms of multimodal data can be used to improve DDA classification performance of PD, over clean EEG or behavioral time series data on their own, in two distinct virtual reach to grasp tasks in an uncertain and dynamic virtual reality environment. Thus, multimodal DDA may provide a tool for aiding the clinician in the diagnosis of PD and bolster classification performance through the combination of a wide array of neural or behavioral signals.",,,Diagnosis,Neurodegenation,BioPotential,,,,bibm49941.2020.9313394,IEEE Conferences,

Understanding the neurophysiological difference between ""voluntary stopping""Â and ""involuntary stopping""Â caused by FOG is vital for the detection of and potential intervention for FOG in the daily lives of patients. This study characterised the electroencephalographic (EEG) signature associated with FOG in contrast to voluntary stopping. The protocol consisted of a timed up-and-go (TUG) task and an additional TUG task with a voluntary stopping component, where participants reacted to verbal ""stop""Â and ""walk""Â instructions by voluntarily stopping or walking. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis was performed to study the dynamics of the EEG spectra induced by different walking phases, including normal walking, voluntary stopping and episodes of involuntary stopping (FOG), as well as the transition windows between normal walking and voluntary stopping or FOG. These results demonstrate for the first time that the EEG signal during the transition from walking to voluntary stopping is distinguishable from that during the transition to involuntary stopping caused by FOG. The EEG signature of voluntary stopping exhibits a significantly decreased power spectrum compared with that of FOG episodes, with distinctly different patterns in the delta and low-beta power in the central area. These findings suggest the possibility of a practical EEG-based tool that can accurately predict FOG episodes, excluding the potential confounding of voluntary stopping.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,BioPotential,,,,tnsre.2021.3107106,IEEE Journals,

Badaoui,2020,IEEE Sensors Letters,Sensor applications;balanced gait;center of pressure (COP);linear and quadratic discriminant analysis;load distribution;unbalanced gait;vertical ground reaction forces (VGRFs),"Gait analysis using kinetic data such as pressure distribution underneath the foot has been a topic of interest for assessing falls in elderly and certain pathology such as Parkinson's disease. The disease which affects the central nervous system cannot be ultimately diagnosed by a test. In this letter, we describe a detection algorithm able to classify subjects into Parkinson or normal subjects based on load distribution during gait. This will allow those with the disease to benefit from early detection and thus early treatment. We perform spatial and time signal analyses over vertical ground reaction forces to categorize gaits as balanced or unbalanced, where unbalanced gaits correspond to subjects with Parkinson's disease and balanced gaits could be relevant to both normal and diseased subjects. Then simple features like correlation are used to further differentiate between balanced-normal subjects and balanced-diseased subjects. A 95% overall classification accuracy has been achieved using a linear decision boundary. This letter can be employed to form the basis of designing a portable device for early Parkinson's disease detection on a real-time basis. Moreover, it can be used for evaluation purposes of a rehabilitation program.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,,,lsens.2020.2994938,IEEE Journals,

Usually, phonation and articulation changes are estimated and evaluated using different methods and statistical frameworks. Speech is especially relevant as a vehicular mechanism to monitor neurological evolution using well-known features extracted from sustained phonations (mainly vowels), diadochokinetic exercises, or running speech. Recent studies have shown that acoustic neurostimulation using binaural beats influences the cognitive and neuromotor conditions of patients with PD, at least temporarily after stimulation. The aim of this study is to describe an added-value solution considering the cooperation of both previously mentioned methods: speech analysis-based monitoring called within the project, Monitoring Parkinson using Locution (MonParLoc), and acoustical neurostimulation, called within project neuro-Acoustic-stimulation Parkinson (AcousticPar). The applications designed in both projects are embedded into a global solution denominated Teca-Park which consists of four main activities: speech evaluation, neurostimulation, motor symptom longitudinally, and questionnaires. This framework is conceived to be a powerful tool for treating and monitoring longitudinally remotely and contact-free. MonParLoc was tested and validated in real scenarios involving patient associations. Validation results produced in these associations demonstrating the utility of this approach are given in the study, particularly in reference to protocol vulnerability and robustness.

Predicting State Transition in Freezing of Gait via Acceleration Measurements for Controlled Cueing in Parkinson's Disease,A. Halder; R. Singh; A. Suri; D. Joshi,2021,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,Accelerometer;cue device;freezing of gait (FoG),"Freezing of gait (FoG) leads to imbalance and falls in Parkinson's disease. Cues potentially prevent FoG occurrence and unfreeze the patient from FoG. Although FoG detection and its prediction have been intensively studied, its termination is mostly neglected. Continuous cueing after the termination of freezing is annoying and has potential side effects in the long term. In this article, for the first time, we attempt to develop a machine learning approach for the prediction of start and termination of freezing, which can potentially provide automated controlled cueing in Parkinson's individuals. We hypothesize certain attributes that correspond to the transition from walking to freezing and vice versa. To this end, we propose unique labeling of classes to predict freezing termination as follows: no FoG, pre-FoG (immediate state preceding FoG), FoG, and pre of post FoG (state just before unfreezing). Daphnet dataset, freely available online, was utilized to develop customized attributes measured from accelerometers with the data recorded from ten participants. The high-dimensional attributes were reduced using a principal component (PC) analysis before being fed to the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier for prediction. With 45 PCs, we achieved average (SD) precision, sensitivity, specificity, f1 score, and accuracy of 95.55% (4.60%), 94.97% (4.86%), 99.19% (0.85%), 95.25% (4.72%), and 98.92% (1.56%), respectively, across the four classes while utilizing the attributes from 60 data points (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\approx 0.93$ </tex-math></inline-formula> s) prior to a given instant.

Based on recorded videos of normal gaits, a mask R-CNN, which is a modern deep neural network for objects segmentation, is applied for extracting human silhouettes from video frames. Gait energy images (GEIs) are then obtained from human silhouettes extracted from video clips of normal gaits and processed as features, which are applied to construct a one class support vector machine (OCSVM) model for normal/PD gaits classification.

Continuous Identification of Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Patients Using Artificial Neural Networks and Instrumented Shoes,A. Prado; S. K. Kwei; N. Vanegas-Arroyave; S. K. Agrawal,2021,IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics,Predictive models;wearable sensors;data models;gait recognition,"Freezing of gait is an episodic phenomena faced by many patients with Parkinson's disease. It is characterized by episodes during which patients are unable to generate effective forward stepping movements, despite absence of motor deficits. During the onset of the event, the patients are less stable with statistically different stride width, toe in/out angle and center of pressure distance. It has been postulated that the degree of freezing can be reduced by providing external sensory feedback to the patients during the event. However, this intervention could be facilitated by accurate identification of freezing events in real-time. This manuscript presents an Artificial Neural Network model which uses signals recorded by an instrumented footwear to predict if a walking subject is having a freezing episode. Our model presented in this paper is capable of continuously predicting freezing of gait events at a high temporal resolution of 50 Hz, using a 0.5 second window of data recorded by the instrumented shoes, with a sensitivity of 96.0Ã‚Â±2.5%, a specificity of 99.6Ã‚Â±0.3%, a precision of 89.5Ã‚Â±5.9%, and an accuracy of 99.5Ã‚Â±0.4%.

It is very common in the elderly after Alzheimer's disease, affecting about 1% of the elderly worldwide. According to international statistics, the number of patients with Parkinson's is increasing every day, so that by 2030, their population will double. Parkinson's has no definitive cure and on the other hand, its severity increases over time so that the person can not do their daily tasks independently. Therefore, knowing the progression of this disease in the early stages can be helpful in controlling and preventing its progression.

Toward a Wearable System for Predicting Freezing of Gait in People Affected by Parkinson's Disease,F. Demrozi; R. Bacchin; S. Tamburin; M. Cristani; G. Pravadelli,2020,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Freezing of gait;wearable device;accelerometer;explainable machine learning;classifica-tion,"Some wearable solutions exploiting on-body acceleration sensors have been proposed to recognize Freezing of Gait (FoG) in people affected by Parkinson Disease (PD). Once a FoG event is detected, these systems generate a sequence of rhythmic stimuli to allow the patient restarting the gait. While these solutions are effective in detecting FoG events, they are unable to predict FoG to prevent its occurrence. This paper fills in the gap by presenting a machine learning-based approach that classifies accelerometer data from PD patients, recognizing a pre-FOG phase to further anticipate FoG occurrence in advance. Gait was monitored by three tri-axial accelerometer sensors worn on the back, hip and ankle. Gait features were then extracted from the accelerometer's raw data through data windowing and non-linear dimensionality reduction. A k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was used to classify gait in three classes of events: pre-FoG, no-FoG and FoG. The accuracy of the proposed solution was compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our study showed that: (i) we achieved performances overcoming the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of FoG detection, (ii) we were able, for the very first time in the literature, to predict FoG by identifying the pre-FoG events with an average sensitivity and specificity of, respectively, 94.1% and 97.1%, and (iii) our algorithm can be executed on resource-constrained devices.

Identification of Gait Events in Healthy and Parkinson's Disease Subjects Using Inertial Sensors: A Supervised Learning Approach,J. C. PÃƒÂ©rez-Ibarra; A. A. G. Siqueira; H. I. Krebs,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,Gait analysis;gait phases;wearable sensors;machine learning;meta-heuristics,"Automatic detection of gait phases through supervised learning is a feasible approach that takes advantage of the consistency of the gait cycle among healthy subjects. However, gait patterns among subjects with impairments are not as consistent and most of the existing algorithms have limited performance detecting phases during impaired gait. In this paper, we proposed one algorithm that used linear classifiers to detect in real-time the transition between consecutive gait phases. Our approach is a generalization of the rule- and threshold-based algorithms for event detection. Linear classifiers are parametric models that require appropriate values in order to perform correct classification of the gait phases. We introduced a modified Support Vector Machine (SVM) to compute such sub-optimal combinations of those values, and a further optimization with a hybrid meta-heuristic approach that integrates a Genetic and a Simulated Annealing Algorithm. We tested our approach on data collected by a single-IMU foot-mounted wearable device during overground and treadmill walking for two groups: one with healthy and one with Parkinson's Disease subjects. The F<sub>1</sub>-scores were 0.987 and 0.953 for the two groups, which were comparable with our previously developed threshold-based method, which obtained 0.988 and 0.974, respectively.

In this study, spirals and straight lines in polar coordinates are used to extract polar expression features such as the key parameters deviation (cm) and accumulation angle (rad). These parameters are quantitative manner to scale the variations of functional tremors in normal control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). However, difficulty arises in using nonlinear polar expression features in the two-dimensional feature space to separate normal control subjects from those with PD and ET. To solve the nonlinear separable classification problem, hash transformation is used to map polar expression features to a high-dimensional space using hash weighing function and modulo operation. Then, a machine learning method, such as the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), is implemented to train a decision-making classifier using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for possible class assessment. With the enrolled data from 50 subjects, the fivefold cross validation, mean true positive, mean true negative, and mean hit rates of 98.93%, 98.96%, and 98.93%, respectively, are obtained to quantify the performance of the proposed decision-making classifier to identify normal controls and subjects with PD or ET.

Principal component analysis was developed in 1901 and has been a strong contender in this role since, but in the end is an unsupervised method. It offers no guarantee that the features selected have predictive power because it does not know what is being predicted. To this end, Peng et al. developed the minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (mRMR) method in 2005. It uses the mutual information not only between predictors but also with the response in its calculation. Estimating mutual information and entropy tend to be expensive and problematic endeavors, which leads to excessive processing times even for data that is approximately 750 by 750 in a Leave-One-Subject- Out jackknife situation. To remedy this, we use a method from 2012 called Distance Correlation Sure Independence Screening (DC-SIS) which uses the distance correlation measure of SzÃƒÂ©kely et al. to select features that have the greatest dependence with the response.

When the literature about the speech disorders-based PD diagnosis was reviewed, it was seen that the most of approaches were concentrated on the feature selection as the datasets contained a huge number of features. In contrast, in the proposed approach, instead of eliminating some of the features by using any feature selection method, all features were initially used for forming a mapping procedure where the input feature vectors were converted to the input images. Then, a deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network was employed for PD detection where the obtained images were used. The deep LSTM network carried out both feature extraction and classification processes and its training was carried out in an end-to-end fashion. The activations in the convolutional layer were converted to sequence data through the sequence-folding and sequence-unfolding layers. The activations in the LSTM output with learning parameters were conveyed to the Softmax layer for the classification process.

Although many biomarkers for age and disease exist, the EEG has the benefit that it is widely available, inexpensive, and potentially may act as a biomarker over rapid time scales, which might be beneficial during, e.g., the performance of a specific task such as neurofeedback games. Parkinson&#x0027;s disease (PD) is ideally suited for the exploration of oscillatory biomarkers since abnormal oscillations have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of PD. Specifically, beta-band oscillations may be broadly considered &#x201C;anti-kinetic&#x201D; and seen as inhibiting movement, while gamma-band oscillations are considered &#x201C;pro-kinetic&#x201D; and appear to facilitate movement. However, many domain-based EEG features in people with PD overlap considerably with those just seen in normal aging. Here, we contrast the age-related EEG features in PD subjects and age-matched healthy controls (HC). We employed an end-to-end training strategy and built deep recurrent neural network models with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to predict age from 60-s of rest EEG recorded from PD and HC. When reliable models with reasonable errors were found for both groups (<tex>$MAE=1.897$</tex> for HC and <tex>$MAE=2.172$</tex> for PD), we investigated their deterioration of predictive power when fed frequency band-limited data. In PD subjects, beta and gamma bands in channels T7, FP2, and F7 were significantly more important for predicting age in PD than in HC. After medication, differences in the frequency bands predicting age between PD and controls become more prominent when PD subjects were on medication. Our results suggest that after the development of PD, beta and gamma become more strongly associated with age, implying that future studies examining beta and gamma changes in PD will need to take particular care in controlling for the age of subjects.",,,Diagnosis,Neurodegenation,BioPotential,,,,icbme54433.2021.9750334,IEEE Conferences,

Lai,2021,IEEE Sensors Journal,Non-contact measurement;X-band microwave;time-domain parametric features;upper limb tremor;linear relationship quantizer,"Consensus criteria for tremor classification in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are clinically important for automatically evaluating the PD rating scale. Wearable sensing tools with direct contact measurements can obtain physiological signals to monitor tremor symptoms. Then, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can train the frequency-based parameters and motion features to accurately measure PD-related tremors. Noncontact measurement with customized computer information devices can also digitalize the digitized handwritten patterns with the bespoke movements that a hand makes for identifying tremor classes. However, wearable sensors need a set of multiple electrodes to be placed on a patient's body to acquire biosignals, and the setup does not allow continuous measurement and limits the patient's motion range. The handwritten patterns of noncontact-based methods need frequency-domain and linearization transformations. In addition, feature extraction methods and MLAs are limited in complex computations and adaptive applications. Hence, in this work, a noncontact measurement with an array X-band microwave (10 GHz) Doppler-based linear quantizer is designed to continuously measure upper limb movements for tremor class scaling. To overcome the complex computations, time-domain parametric features, including zero crossing (ZC), Willison amplitude (WAMP), and waveform length (WL) indexes, are used to extract the physical changes in the oscillation frequencies, amplitudes, and directions of tremor signals for scaling upper limb tremor (ULT) levels. In the experiments involving 10 subjects, the proposed noncontact bioradar sensor could quantify asymmetrical and irregular oscillations with a positive correlation (mean R<sup>2</sup> > 0.85) between the three indexes (ZC, WAMP, WL) and various oscillation frequencies.

Suominen,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),bioinformatics;biomarkers;feature extraction;machine learning;neurology;predictive models;signal analysis;statistical analysis,"Computer-assisted quantification and analysis of postural sway may support identifying individuals affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). Balancing, and its associated postural sway, is a complex process that requires the cooperation of several sensory systems in the brain. Unsurprisingly, a neurodegenerative disease can affect such processes, manifesting itself in the postural sway of affected individuals. Different aspects of postural sway can be quantified and represented as features, which can be used to distinguish between patients and controls. Our aim, inspired by a recent systematic literature review, was to experimentally determine whether sampling frequency and visual state had a meaningful impact on the effectiveness of features in distinguishing between the two groups, and whether overall discriminability could be improved using machine learning. We extracted 102 unique features from 78 postural sway recordings and found that the effectiveness (quantified by an effect size and the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz was superior to 20, 40, and 100 Hz, though not with high confidence (quantified through Bayesian analysis). We also concluded that effectiveness under the eyes closed condition was higher than the eyes open condition (confirmed through Bayesian analysis), though combining features from both conditions was superior. Finally, we showed that using machine learning to analyse multiple features through feature selection resulted in higher discriminability in almost all cases.

However, analyzing unsupervised gait tests relies on reliable test annotations by the patients requiring a potentially error-prone interaction with the recording system. To overcome this limitation, this work presents a novel algorithmic pipeline for the automated detection of unsupervised standardized gait tests from continuous real-world IMU data. In a study with twelve Parkinson's disease patients, we recorded real-world gait data over two weeks using foot-worn IMUs. During continuous daily recordings, the participants performed series of three consecutive <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${4}\times {10}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Meters-Walking-Tests (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${4}\times {10}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>MWTs) at different walking speeds, besides their usual daily-living activities.

In the evaluation with 419 available gait test series, the detection reached an F1-score of 88.9% and the decomposition an F1-score of 94.0%.

Early symptoms of PD are rest tremors, bradykinesia and rigidity. Common signs are a decrease in arm swing, shuffling foot movement and slowness arising from a chair. Rigidity of muscles commonly affects a patient limbs, neck and shoulder PD is currently diagnosed after the neuro degenerative process has started. To optimize and improve PD quality of care, it should be diagnosed early in its onset once symptoms are not yet evident. The current gold standard for patient assessment of PD is the completion of symptom diaries. These diaries are subjective and usually do not accurately reflect what is taking place throughout the day. It is exceedingly difficult for an untrained observer such as family members to provide accurate description of movement characteristic in PD. An alternative way to exercise the abnormal movement in PD is to use a wearable technology system which could aid early detection of the disease and help clinicians manage medication when symptoms fluctuate throughout the day. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of a wearable multi-sensor kinematic system capable of detecting the tell-tale signs of PD when performing tailored exercise routines.

This disease is more evident in aged people who are a formidable population around the globe. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a continuous growing disease of nervous system that affects largely the regular daily activities and impedes movement of the person. The symptoms of PD patients may vary across geography and communities. Proper and timely Parkinson's disease diagnosis and prediction is an innovative research in medicine. In existent clinical diagnosis as practiced by doctors globally, One of the diagnosing methods is to study tremor signals. Tremor assessments methods include computerized tremor analysis, clinical assessment of drawn figures, standardized rating scales and simple clinical observations. To cater purpose of a clinical research, various rating scales has been developed which suit patient's population. One of the earlier scale used is to measure tremor is Fahn- Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS). This is 5-point scale which rates tremor severity predicted from its amplitude, from 0 (no tremor) to 4 (serious tremor) in each part of the body. Primary objective of work under taken is to develop a tremor detection prototype using Raspberry Pi processor equipped with accelerometer and flex sensors. Neurological tremor thus collected from this module is used to build dataset of subjects among the population. Eventually, innovative machine learning algorithms namely Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms are designed to predict onset of disease using this dataset.

Ye,2021,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Bradykinesia;electromagnetic tracking;inertial sensing;Parkinson's disease;tremor,"Neurologists judge the severity of Parkinsonian motor symptoms according to clinical scales, and their judgments exist inconsistent because of differences in clinical experience. Correspondingly, inertial sensing-based wearable devices (ISWDs) produce objective and standardized quantifications. However, ISWDs indirectly quantify symptoms by parametric modeling of angular velocities and linear accelerations nd trained by the judgments of several neurologists through supervised learning algorithms. Hence, the ISWD outputs are biased along with the scores provided by neurologists. To investigate the effectiveness ISWDs for Parkinsonian symptoms quantification, technical verification and clinical validation of both tremor and bradykinesia quantification methods were carried out. A total of 45 Parkinson's disease patients and 30 healthy controls performed the tremor and finger-tapping tasks, which were tracked simultaneously by an ISWD and a 6-axis high-precision electromagnetic tracking system (EMTS). The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) prescribed parameters obtained from the EMTS, which directly provides linear and rotational displacements, were compared with the scores provided by both the ISWD and seven neurologists. EMTS-based parameters were regarded as the ground truth and were employed to train several common machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF) algorithms. Inconsistency among the scores provided by the neurologists was proven. Besides, the quantification performance (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) of the ISWD employed with ML algorithms were better than that of the neurologists. Furthermore, EMTS can be utilized to both modify the quantification algorithms of ISWDs and improve the assessment skills of young neurologists.",,,Diagnosis,Tremor,Wearable,,,,jbhi.2020.3009319,IEEE Journals,
Real-Time Detection of Gait Events by Recurrent Neural Networks,F. -C. Wang; Y. -C. Li; T. -Y. Kuo; S. -F. Chen; C. -H. Lin,2021,IEEE Access,Gait;neural network;deep learning;heel strike;stroke;Parkinson's disease,"This paper proposes a gait detection model that can recognize important gait events in real time. Human gaits are periodic, with each gait cycle containing the important gait events of mid-swing, heel-strike (HS), and toe-off. The correct identification of different gait patterns caused by stroke or progressive neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease could ensure that the patients receive appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies. However, online detection of gait events can be challenging because each person has their own walking patterns and speeds. This paper applies recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to develop a model that can instantly detect important gait events in any subject. We collected clinical gait data and used them to develop an RNN model for real-time detection of HS. The model correctly recognized HS events with an average success rate of 98.84% and an average delay of 0.024 s in the laboratory environment. We then applied the model to three different groups of subjects: healthy elderly subjects, stroke patients, and patients with Parkinson's disease. The developed RNN model also correctly recognized HS events in all three groups with an average accuracy of more than 99.65%, even though the subjects had very different walking patterns. In the future, the developed gait detection model can be integrated with real-time rehabilitation systems to provide patients with repetitive guidance using clinician-determined cures for enhanced clinical gait training.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,,,access.2021.3116047,IEEE Journals,

Accurate assessment of FoG is critical for the management of PD and to evaluate the efficacy of treatments. Currently, the assessment of FoG requires well-trained experts to perform time-consuming annotations via vision-based observations. Thus, automatic FoG detection algorithms are needed. In this study, we formulate vision-based FoG detection, as a fine-grained graph sequence modelling task, by representing the anatomic joints in each temporal segment with a directed graph, since FoG events can be observed through the motion patterns of joints. A novel deep learning method is proposed, namely graph sequence recurrent neural network (GS-RNN), to characterize the FoG patterns by devising graph recurrent cells, which take graph sequences of dynamic structures as inputs. For the cases of which prior edge annotations are not available, a data-driven based adjacency estimation method is further proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies on vision-based FoG detection using deep neural networks designed for graph sequences of dynamic structures.

Feng,2020,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Parkinson's disease;freezing of gait detection;deep learning;graph convolution neural network,"Parkinson's disease significantly impacts the life quality of millions of people around the world. While freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most common symptoms of the disease, it is time consuming and subjective to assess FoG for well-trained experts. Therefore, it is highly desirable to devise computer-aided FoG detection methods for the purpose of objective and time-efficient assessment. In this paper, in line with the gold standard of FoG clinical assessment, which requires video or direct observation, we propose one of the first vision-based methods for automatic FoG detection. To better characterize FoG patterns, instead of learning an overall representation of a video, we propose a novel architecture of graph convolution neural network and represent each video as a directed graph where FoG related candidate regions are the vertices. A weakly-supervised learning strategy and a weighted adjacency matrix estimation layer are proposed to eliminate the resource expensive data annotation required for fully supervised learning. As a result, the interference of visual information irrelevant to FoG, such as gait motion of supporting staff involved in clinical assessments, has been reduced to improve FoG detection performance by identifying the vertices contributing to FoG events. To further improve the performance, the global context of a clinical video is also considered and several fusion strategies with graph predictions are investigated. Experimental results on more than 100 videos collected from 45 patients during a clinical assessment demonstrated promising performance of our proposed method with an AUC of 0.887.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Video Recording,,,,jbhi.2019.2923209,IEEE Journals,

The increase in data volume due to arising long-term monitoring requires valid, robust and efficient analysis pipelines. In many studies an upstream detection of gait is therefore applied. However, current methods do not provide a robust way to successfully reject non-gait signals. Therefore, we developed a novel algorithm for the detection of gait from continuous inertial data of sensors worn at the feet. The algorithm is focused not only on a high sensitivity but also a high specificity for gait. Sliding windows of IMU signals recorded from the feet of PD patients were processed in the frequency domain. Gait was detected if the frequency spectrum contained specific patterns of harmonic frequencies. The approach was trained and evaluated on 150 clinical measurements containing standardized gait and cyclic movement tests. The detection reached a sensitivity of 0.98 and a specificity of 0.96 for the best sensor configuration (angular rate around the medio-lateral axis). On an independent validation data set including 203 unsupervised, semi-standardized gait tests, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.97.

Spectro-Temporal Sparsity Characterization for Dysarthric Speech Detection,I. Kodrasi; H. Bourlard,2020,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",Non-parametric sparsity;parametric sparsity;SVM;DTW;Parkinson's disease,"To assist the clinical diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases that cause speech dysarthria such as Parkinson's disease (PD), it is of paramount importance to craft robust features which can be used to automatically discriminate between healthy and dysarthric speech. Since dysarthric speech of patients suffering from PD is breathy, semi-whispery, and is characterized by abnormal pauses and imprecise articulation, it can be expected that its spectro-temporal sparsity differs from the spectro-temporal sparsity of healthy speech. While we have recently successfully used temporal sparsity characterization for dysarthric speech detection, characterizing spectral sparsity poses the challenge of constructing a valid feature vector from signals with a different number of unaligned time frames. Further, although several non-parametric and parametric measures of sparsity exist, it is unknown which sparsity measure yields the best performance in the context of dysarthric speech detection. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the advantages of spectro-temporal sparsity characterization for automatic dysarthric speech detection. To this end, we first provide a numerical analysis of the suitability of different non-parametric and parametric measures (i.e., l<sub>1</sub>-norm, kurtosis, Shannon entropy, Gini index, shape parameter of a Chi distribution, and shape parameter of a Weibull distribution) for sparsity characterization. It is shown that kurtosis, the Gini index, and the parametric sparsity measures are advantageous sparsity measures, whereas the l<sub>1</sub>-norm and entropy measures fail to robustly characterize the temporal sparsity of signals with a different number of time frames. Second, we propose to characterize the spectral sparsity of an utterance by initially time-aligning it to the same utterance uttered by a (arbitrarily selected) reference speaker using dynamic time warping. Experimental results on a Spanish database of healthy and dysarthric speech show that estimating the spectro-temporal sparsity using the Gini index or the parametric sparsity measures and using it as a feature in a support vector machine results in a high classification accuracy of 83.3%.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,taslp.2020.2985066,IEEE Journals,

Chen,2020,2020 Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC),Parkinson's disease;FoG;Feature Extraction;Machine learning,"As one of the most common gaits disorders in Parkinson's motor symptoms, freezing of gait FoG severely interferes with patients' daily activities and causes them to fall, which has significant clinical and social consequences. What's worse, there is neither clear pathogenesis nor effective therapeutic regiment at present, making it urgent to develop effective adjuvant treatment, intervention methods to alleviate motor symptoms and improve mobility of patients. As the basis for the implementation of intervention measures, the detection of FoG can also provide symptom information for subsequent disease assessment. Therefore, the detection of FoG has important research significance and application value. This paper proposes a FoG detection system based on motion signals collected by wearable devices and machine learning techniques. A stepwise feature extraction method is proposed to detect FoG by first separating acceleration signal into body acceleration, gravity and FoG acceleration, then calculating the jerk and Euclidean norm of each component, finally extracting a series of temporal and frequency domain features that can reflect the characteristics of FoG and using them to train the classifier. The work characterizes the performance system on user-dependent and user-independent experiment. Furthermore, different preprocessing window size, feature selection methods and classification algorithms are also evaluated. The best result obtained belongs to Light Gradient Boosting Machine LightGBM with 256 sample window size and the feature selection based on mutual information method. The best result achieved an accuracy of 88.62%, a sensitivity of 87.69%, a specificity of 89.29% and an AUC of 88.49%, respectively, enhancing the results of former methods and providing a more balanced rate of sensitivity and specificity.",,,Diagnosis,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,,,ccdc49329.2020.9164331,IEEE Conferences,

Its early detection plays an important role in the diagnosis of the disease as it is often mistaken for another type of tremor, called Essential Tremor (ET). Accelerometry analysis has proven to be a trustworthy method for determining the frequency, amplitude, and occurrence of tremor. In addition, the use of portable and wearable sensors has increased due to the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, allowing data to be collected, processed, stored, and transmitted. In this paper, a wearable system consisting of a digital 3-axis accelerometer ADXL345 and micro-controller unit ESP32 was implemented to transmit accelerometry (ACC) signals from each upper limb simultaneously to a Graphical User Interface (GUI), that was developed in Python as an MQTT client, allowing the user to visualize both real-time and offline signals as well as to add markers to indicate events during the acquisition. Furthermore, this GUI is capable of performing an offline analysis consisting of the computing of Power Spectral Density (PSD) using Welch's method and a Spectrogram to visualize a time-frequency distribution of the ACC signals.",,,Diagnosis,Tremor,Wearable,,,,embc46164.2021.9630367,IEEE Conferences,

Parkinsonian tremor is one of the earliest and major surrogate biomarker which indicates the progress or status of the disease for patients under treatment using drugs or deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy. However, it is a challenging issue as tremor occurs at the minor extremities like fingers in some cases such as pill-rolling symptom, the effect of the same on a wrist-worn motion sensor system is not significant enough to be captured. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using the wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG) as a novel sensor modality in detecting tremor at rest. Our preliminary results gathered from healthy cohorts performing simulations of Parkinsonian tremor elucidates the merit of the proposed method. Also, since PPG acquisition is power-hungry, we have leveraged a conceptual method of compressive sensing to reduce the overall power requirement of the application.",,,Diagnosis,Tremor,Wearable,,,,eusipco47968.2020.9287346,IEEE Conferences,

However, novel methods are still needed for BN analysis. Therefore, in this study, BNs were constructed based on stable and unstable EEG components, and these may be implemented for disease diagnosis. Methods: Parkinson's disease (PD) was used as an example to illustrate this method. First, EEG signals were decomposed into dynamic modes (DMs). Each DM contains one eigenvalue that can determine not only the stability of that mode, but also its corresponding oscillatory frequency. Second, the stable and unstable components of EEG signals in each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha and beta) were calculated, which are based on the stable and unstable DMs within each respective frequency band. Third, newly developed BNs were constructed, including stable brain network (SBN), unstable brain network (UBN) and inter-connected brain network (IBN). Finally, their topological attributes were extracted in order to differentiate between PD patients and healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, topological attributes were also derived from traditional brain network (TBN) for comparison. Results: Most topological attributes of SBN, UBN and IBN can significantly differentiate between PD patients and HC (p value <; 0.05). Furthermore, the area under the curve (AUC), precision and recall values of SBN analysis are all significantly higher than TBN. Conclusion: We proposed a new perspective on EEG BN analysis. Significance: These newly developed BNs not only have biological significance, but also could be widely applied in most medical and engineering fields.",,,Diagnosis,Neurodegenation,BioPotential,,,,jbhi.2020.3015471,IEEE Journals,

The diagnostic system is an ensemble of four binary classifications. The proposed technique is applied to gait dynamics data recorded from 64 subjects representing three NDDs: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Huntington's Disease (HD), in addition to healthy subjects. Our results demonstrate the ability of the proposed technique to recognize gait dynamics of ALS, PD and HD with an accuracy of 96.8, 86.8% and 85.5%, respectively.

We represent utterances through articulatory posteriors and consider pairs of phonetically-balanced representations, with one representation from a healthy speaker (i.e., the reference representation) and the other representation from the test speaker (i.e., test representation). Given such pairs of reference and test representations, features are first extracted using a feature extraction front-end, a frame-level distance matrix is computed, and the obtained distance matrix is considered as an image by a CNN-based binary classifier. The feature extraction, distance matrix computation, and CNN-based classifier are jointly optimized in an end-to-end framework.

We first use the physical models of sensor data obtained from a foot-mounted inertial system to differentiate stationary and moving segments of the sensor data. Next, we develop an optimization routine called sparsity-assisted wavelet denoising (SAWD), which simultaneously combines linear time invariant filters, orthogonal multiresolution representations such as wavelets, and sparsity-based methods, to generate a sparse template of the moving segments of the gyroscope measurements in the sagittal plane for valid gait cycles. Thereafter, to validate any moving segment as a gait cycle, we compute the root-mean-square error between the generated sparse template and the sparse representation of the moving segment of the gyroscope data in the sagittal plane obtained using SAWD. Finally, we find the local minima for the stationary and moving segments of a valid gait cycle to detect the gait events. We compare our proposed method with existing methods, for a fixed threshold, using real data obtained from three groups, namely controls, participants with Parkinson disease, and geriatric participants.

V,2020,2020 5th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Electronics (ICEE),Tremor analysis;Accelerometer;FFT;Data acquisition,"Tremor is an involuntary movement of limbs that occurs with certain neurological disorders. The neurological disorders include Parkinson&#x0027;s disease, Huntington disease, spino cerebellar degenerations, etc., In all these diseases the limbs of the patient move involuntarily and rhythmically. It can affect any part of the body either one side or both the sides symmetrically. The neuro physician during the assessment of the patient depends on video-grapy or Electromyography or both. Even then the physician does not get the complete information, as these techniques are very primitive, apart from being uneconomical. Also they require lot of time for recording and analysis. Even the information preservation also becomes difficult. In certain cases, the physician mainly depends on the feedback from the patient. In order to overcome these difficulties and also to reduce the time and even cost, a technique has been proposed and implemented. The technique involves recording the tremor using a tri-axial accelerometer, which can be fastened to the limb, where the measurements need to be recorded. The analog output from the accelerometer is amplified and fed to a microcontroller for onward transmission of the sampled values to PC. In PC a Matlab program acquires these samples and processes the same for amplitude and frequency related information. The data was obtained from 15 patients having various neurological disorders and a set of 10 controlled groups is also considered.

First, user data often exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Second, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this article, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning.

Delopoulos,2020,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Accelerometers;artificial neural networks;medical diagnosis;smart devices;supervised learning,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a slowly evolving neurological disease that affects about 1% of the population above 60 years old, causing symptoms that are subtle at first, but whose intensity increases as the disease progresses. Automated detection of these symptoms could offer clues as to the early onset of the disease, thus improving the expected clinical outcomes of the patients via appropriately targeted interventions. This potential has led many researchers to develop methods that use widely available sensors to measure and quantify the presence of PD symptoms such as tremor, rigidity and braykinesia. However, most of these approaches operate under controlled settings, such as in lab or at home, thus limiting their applicability under free-living conditions. In this work, we present a method for automatically identifying tremorous episodes related to PD, based on IMU signals captured via a smartphone device. We propose a Multiple-Instance Learning approach, wherein a subject is represented as an unordered bag of accelerometer signal segments and a single, expert-provided, tremor annotation. Our method combines deep feature learning with a learnable pooling stage that is able to identify key instances within the subject bag, while still being trainable end-to-end. We validate our algorithm on a newly introduced dataset of 45 subjects, containing accelerometer signals collected entirely in-the-wild. The good classification performance obtained in the conducted experiments suggests that the proposed method can efficiently navigate the noisy environment of in-the-wild recordings.",,,Diagnosis,Tremor,Smartphone,,,,jbhi.2019.2961748,IEEE Journals,

Fan; L.

The gait fluctuations reflect the physiology and pathologic alterations in the locomotor control system. Using gait fluctuations for disease state evaluation is an essential way for clinical trials and healthcare monitoring. The classification of gait fluctuations helps improve the life quality and enhance clinical diagnosis ability in neuro-degenerative patients. In this work, we firstly embed the time series of multiple gait fluctuations into the phase space. Then we use persistent homology to extract the topological signatures of barcodes. Together with a random forest classifier, we proposed a topological motion analysis (TMA) framework to analyze the gait fluctuations. Further, we proposed a comprehensive comparison study using the TMA framework in the neuro-degenerative classification tasks for stance-, stride-, and swing-based gait fluctuations. In the tasks of comparing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) to the healthy control (HC) group, the best-achieved AUC scores were 0.9135, 0.9906 and 0.9667 respectively, which show the effectiveness of TMA framework.

Methods: A gaze-tracker based in video-oculography technology was used. Before EM tests, clinical data were collected, participants performed a cognitive test to discard subtle abnormalities and signed an informed consent form. To demonstrate the relationship between EM and brain aging, a linear or quadratic model was computed and statistical analysis among groups was presented. Conclusion: EM variables could be considered as biomarkers to measure the aging effect and functionality of the brain. Video-oculography is a suitable technique for measuring EM in clinical practice.

Lin,2021,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Disease forecasting;deep generative models;progression uncertainty;neural networks,"Forecasting patients' disease progressions with rich longitudinal clinical data has drawn much attention in recent years due to its impactful application in healthcare and the medical field. Researchers have tackled this problem by leveraging traditional machine learning, statistical techniques and deep learning based models. However, existing methods suffer from either deterministic internal structures or over-simplified stochastic components, failing to deal with complex uncertain scenarios such as progression uncertainty (i.e., multiple possible trajectories) and data uncertainty (i.e., imprecise observations and misdiagnosis). To overcome these major uncertainty issues, we propose a novel deep generative model, Stochastic Disease Forecasting Model (StoCast), along with an associated neural network architecture StoCastNet, that can be trained efficiently via stochastic optimization techniques. Our StoCast model uses internal stochastic components to deal with departures of observed data from patients' true health states, and more importantly, is able to produce a comprehensive estimate of future disease progression trajectories. Based on two public datasets related to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, we demonstrate how our StoCast model achieves robust and superior performance than deterministic baseline approaches, and conveys richer information that can potentially assist doctors to make decisions with greater confidence in a complex uncertain scenario.",,,Diagnosis,,,,,,jbhi.2020.3006719,IEEE Journals,

Berisha,2020,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",Clinical speech analytics;dysarthria;hypernasality;speech features;velopharyngeal dysfunction,"Hypernasality is a common characteristic symptom across many motor-speech disorders. For voiced sounds, hypernasality introduces an additional resonance in the lower frequencies and, for unvoiced sounds, there is reduced articulatory precision due to air escaping through the nasal cavity. However, the acoustic manifestation of these symptoms is highly variable, making hypernasality estimation very challenging, both for human specialists and automated systems. Previous work in this area relies on either engineered features based on statistical signal processing or machine learning models trained on clinical ratings. Engineered features often fail to capture the complex acoustic patterns associated with hypernasality, whereas metrics based on machine learning are prone to overfitting to the small disease-specific speech datasets on which they are trained. Here we propose a new set of acoustic features that capture these complementary dimensions. The features are based on two acoustic models trained on a large corpus of healthy speech. The first acoustic model aims to measure nasal resonance from voiced sounds, whereas the second acoustic model aims to measure articulatory imprecision from unvoiced sounds. To demonstrate that the features derived from these acoustic models are specific to hypernasal speech, we evaluate them across different dysarthria corpora. Our results show that the features generalize even when training on hypernasal speech from one disease and evaluating on hypernasal speech from another disease (e.g., training on Parkinson's disease, evaluation on Huntington's disease), and when training on neurologically disordered speech but evaluating on cleft palate speech.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,taslp.2020.3015035,IEEE Journals,
A Comparison of Cepstral Features in the Detection of Pathological Voices by Varying the Input and Filterbank of the Cepstrum Computation,M. K. Reddy; P. Alku,2021,IEEE Access,Voice disorders;glottal inverse filtering;support vector machine;cepstral coefficients,"Automatic voice pathology detection enables objective assessment of pathologies that affect the voice production mechanism. Detection systems have been developed using the traditional pipeline approach (consisting of the feature extraction part and the detection part) and using the modern deep learning -based end-to-end approach. Due to the lack of vast amounts of training data in the study area of pathological voice, the former approach is still a valid choice. In the existing detection systems based on the traditional pipeline approach, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features can be regarded as the <italic>defacto</italic> standard feature set. In this study, automatic voice pathology detection is investigated by comparing the performance of various MFCC variants derived by considering two factors: the input and the filterbank in the cepstrum computation. For the first factor, three inputs (the voice signal, the glottal source and the vocal tract) are compared. The glottal source and the vocal tract are estimated using the quasi-closed phase glottal inverse filtering method. For the second factor, the mel-frequency and linear-frequency filterbanks are compared. Experiments were conducted separately using six databases consisting of voices produced by speakers suffering from one of four disorders (dysphonia, Parkinson's disease, laryngitis, or heart failure) and by healthy speakers. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier. The results show that by combining mel- and linear-frequency cepstral coefficients derived from the glottal source and vocal tract, better overall detection accuracy was obtained compared to the <italic>defacto</italic> MFCC features derived from the voice signal.

Accelerometer data were collected using sensors positioned on the wrist and finger of the participant's dominant hand. In the study, models for estimation and prediction of the tremor was generated. Machine learning was applied to detect and classify rest, effort, and postural tasks according to two scenarios. In the first scenario, we separated the tasks into three classes, while in the second one, two classes (effort and rest) were used. To compute the statistical features as maximum, minimum, and mean amplitude, number of peaks above the mean, standard deviation (STD), root mean square (RMS), and Pearson correlation of the finger and wrist acceleration, the accelerometer data were divided on windows with different length (128, 256, 320, and 512 samples per window).

This will cause changes in the walking pattern of the disease affected persons. Human gait analysis is one of the best tools to identify every person by their unique walking pattern. The studies state that lacks in clinical diagnosis to identify the neurodegenerative disease is making the person's health condition worse. The accurate diagnosis of brain disorder in a simplified and machine intelligence way will help the doctors in the early treatment progression. This paper is presented to classify and recognize neurodegenerative disease (NDD) patients with gait patterns using double feature extraction methods such as Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) and Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT). To recognize the neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Huntington's Diseases Machine learning techniques were applied. RQA is applied to quantify the input gait left swing pattern and right swing pattern and FWHT is utilized to extract the statistical features. These RQA and FWHT features extracted are further used for recognition of neurodegenerative diseases using Discriminant Analysis, Random forest, Multi SVM and KNN classifiers gives the result of 92.19%, 89.84%, 89.06%, and 89.84% accuracy respectively. Therefore, it is possible to classify and recognize neurodegenerative disease patients by the machine learning algorithms with the gait patterns.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Force/Pressure,,,,iciccs48265.2020.9120920,IEEE Conferences,

An inertial sensor-based algorithm for turning detection during gait,L. Meng; X. Huang; Y. Yang; J. Pang; L. Chen; D. Ming,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),gait;inertial sensors;turning detection;PD;PIGD,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can be divided into two subtypes based on clinical features, namely tremor-dominant (TD) and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD). Detection of PIGD symptoms is crucial for early diagnosis of PD and timely clinical intervention. However, patients at the early stage may not exhibit obvious motor dysfunctions during normal straight walking leading to difficulties in PD identification. Researchers have found that patients would show significant motor deteriorations in turning due to their cognition limitation. Therefore, turning detection is essential for quantitative motion analysis in the gait assessment of PD patients. In this study, we proposed a novel inertial-sensor-based algorithm for turning detection. Ten healthy young participants were enrolled in the experiment where they were required to walk along a 7-meter pathway with two 180 degree turns at their comfortable walking speed. Five inertial sensors were attached to the upper trunk, the shank and the foot of both legs. The algorithm performance was validated using an optical motion capture system for reference and two sensor combination options (upper trunk and shank sensors, upper trunk and foot sensors) were compared. The results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved accuracy over 98% for identifying the turning state of both legs. The integration of the upper trunk and foot sensors had no significant effect on the detection accuracy compared to that with the use of the upper trunk and shank sensors. Our algorithm has the potential to be implemented in the motion analysis model for complicated gait tasks, which has great potential in the early diagnosis of PIGD.",,,Diagnosis,"Gait,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia,

A Proposal for a Linear Calculation of Gait Asymmetry,"van Gelder, Linda; Angelini, Lorenza; Buckley, Ellen; MazzÃƒÂ , Claudia",2021,Symmetry,asymmetry; gait; accelerometer; IMU,"Pathological gait is often associated with a lack of symmetry. A possible way to quantify this feature is to use acceleration data measured by a sensor located on the lower trunk. The most common approach calculates a symmetry index starting from the autocorrelation function, aiming to measure the divergence in motion of the left and right sides of the body. The various methods proposed to implement this approach are based on nonlinear and discontinuous functions, and the interpretation of their output is far from straightforward. The aim of this study was to propose a linear and easier to interpret quantification measure for gait asymmetry. The proposed measure was tested on data from healthy controls and from patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease, and it was shown to negate the flaws present in previous methods and to provide more directly interpretable results.",,,Diagnosis,Gait,Wearable,,,,sym13091560,Article,

Quantifying these mobility patterns could support diagnosing, tracking disease progression and measuring response to treatment. This quantification can be done with wearable technology, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs).

This study proposes a protocol for a dataset that can be used to develop and validate IMU-based mobility algorithms for healthy adults (18-60 years), healthy older adults (&gt;60 years), and patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, a symptomatic stroke and chronic low back pain.

It has a significant role in different applications such as e-security, signature biometrics, e-health, gesture analysis, diagnosis system of Parkinson's disease, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders, analysis of vulnerable people (stressed, elderly, or drugged), prediction of gender, handedness and so on. Classical authentication systems are image-based, text-dependent, and password or fingerprint-based where the former one has the risk of information leakage. Alternatively, image processing and pattern-analysis-based systems are vulnerable to camera attributes, camera frames, light effect, and the quality of the image or pattern. Thus, in this paper, we concentrate on real-time and context-free handwriting data analysis for robust user authentication systems using digital pen-tablet sensor data. Most of the state-of-the-art authentication models show suboptimal performance for improper features. This research proposed a robust and efficient user identification system using an optimal feature selection technique based on the features from the sensor's signal of pen and tablet devices. The proposed system includes more genuine and accurate numerical data which are used for features extraction model based on both the kinematic and statistical features of individual handwritings. Sensor data of digital pen-tablet devices generate high dimensional feature vectors for user identification. However, all the features do not play equal contribution to identify a user. Hence, to find out the optimal features, we utilized a hybrid feature selection model. Extracted features are then fed to the popular machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate a nonlinear classifier through training and testing phases. The experimental result analysis shows that the proposed model achieves more accurate and satisfactory results which ensure the practicality of our system for user identification with low computational cost.",,,Diagnosis,Handwritting,Smartphone/Tablet,,,,fi13090231,Article,

To implement innovative, non-pharmacological, neurostimulation interventions to restore cortical-cortical interactions, we need to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Here, we investigated effective connectivity on source-level resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals in 15 PD participants and 10 healthy controls. First, we fitted multivariate auto-regressive models to the EEG source waveforms. Second, we estimated causal connections using Granger Causality, which provide information on connections' strength and directionality. Lastly, we sought significant differences connectivity patterns between the two populations characterizing the network graph features-i.e., global efficiency and node strength. Causal brain networks in PD show overall poorer and weaker connections compared to controls quantified as a reduction of global efficiency. Motor areas appear almost isolated, with a strongly impoverished information flow particularly from parietal and occipital cortices. This striking isolation of motor areas may reflect an impaired sensory-motor integration in PD. The identification of defective nodes/edges in PD network may be a biomarker of disease and a potential target for future interventional trials.",,,Diagnosis,"Dyskinesia,Limb movements",BioPotential,,,,brainsci11091200,Article,

Focusing on digitized drawings of Archimedean spirals, the present study utilized data from the open-access ParkinsonHW dataset to improve existing PD drawing diagnostic pipelines. Random forest classifiers were constructed using previously documented features and highly-predictive, newly-proposed features that leverage the many unique mathematical characteristics of the Archimedean spiral. This approach yielded an AUC of 0.999 on the particular dataset we tested on, and more importantly identified interpretable features with good promise for generalization across diverse patient cohorts. It demonstrated the potency of mathematical relationships inherent to the drawing shape and the usefulness of sparse feature sets and simple models, which further enhance interpretability, in the face of limited sample size.

Fourteen females with PD (age, 72.6 Ã‚Â± 7.2 years, disease duration, 3.5 Ã‚Â± 2.1 years) were enrolled in this study. All participants performed a submaximal, isometric knee extension ramp-up contraction from 0% to 80% of their maximal voluntary contraction strength. We used high-density surface electromyography with 64 electrodes to record the muscle activity of the vastus lateralis muscle and decomposed the signals with the convolution kernel compensation technique to extract the signals of individual MUs. We calculated the degree of degeneration of the central lesion-specific binding ratio by dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography. The primary, novel results were as follows: (1) moderate-to-strong correlations were observed between the degree of degeneration of the central lesion and MU firing behavior; (2) a moderate correlation was observed between clinical measures of disease severity and MU firing behavior; and (3) the methods of predicting central nervous system degeneration from MU firing behavior abnormalities had a high detection accuracy with an area under the curve &gt;0.83.

The methodology discussed here could be applied to any neurological condition, including the important early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we analyzed EEG from control (CL) participants and participants with diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD), who were age-matched women in an eyes-closed resting state, to test the model. PD is predicted to rise over the next decades as the population ages. Furthermore, women are more likely to undergo PD-related complications and worse disability than men. Two groups based on age were considered: under and over 60 years (PD patients &lt;60 and &gt;60; CL &lt;60 and &gt;60). Continuous Wavelet Transform and Cross Wavelet Transform were applied to determine patterns of global wavelet curves, main frequencies, and power analyses. Our results indicate that both CL age groups and PD patients &lt;60 share a main ÃŽÂ± brainwave and PD patients &gt;60 showed a main ÃŽÂ´ brainwave. Interestingly, power anomalies analyses show a decreasing anteroposterior gradient in CL, whereas it is increasing in PD patients, which was not previously observed.

Vocal Feature Extraction-Based Artificial Intelligent Model for Parkinson's Disease Detection,"Hoq, Muntasir; Uddin, Mohammed; Park, Seung-Bo",2021,Diagnostics,medical analytics; Parkinson's disease detection; principal component analysis; sparse autoencoder; support vector machine,"As a neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD) affects the nerve cells of the human brain. Early detection and treatment can help to relieve the symptoms of PD. Recent PD studies have extracted the features from vocal disorders as a harbinger for PD detection, as patients face vocal changes and impairments at the early stages of PD. In this study, two hybrid models based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) integrating with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) are proposed to detect PD patients based on their vocal features. The first model extracted and reduced the principal components of vocal features based on the explained variance of each feature using PCA. For the first time, the second model used a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN) of an SAE, consisting of multiple hidden layers with L1 regularization to compress the vocal features into lower-dimensional latent space. In both models, reduced features were fed into the SVM as inputs, which performed classification by learning hyperplanes, along with projecting the data into a higher dimension. An F1-score, a Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and a Precision-Recall curve were used, along with accuracy to evaluate the proposed models due to highly imbalanced data. With its highest accuracy of 0.935, F1-score of 0.951, and MCC value of 0.788, the probing results show that the proposed model of the SAE-SVM surpassed not only the former model of the PCA-SVM and other standard models including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF), but also surpassed two recent studies using the same dataset.

Authors have proposed that a machine learning and sensor-based approach that continuously monitors patients in naturalistic settings can provide constant evaluation of PD and objectively analyse its progression. In this paper, we make progress toward such PD evaluation by presenting a multimodal deep learning approach for discriminating between people with PD and without PD. Specifically, our proposed architecture, named MCPD-Net, uses two data modalities, acquired from vision and accelerometer sensors in a home environment to train variational autoencoder (VAE) models. These are modality-specific VAEs that predict effective representations of human movements to be fused and given to a classification module. During our end-to-end training, we minimise the difference between the latent spaces corresponding to the two data modalities. This makes our method capable of dealing with missing modalities during inference. We show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal and other multimodal approaches by an average increase in F1-score of 0.25 and 0.09, respectively, on a data set with real patients. We also show that our method still outperforms other approaches by an average increase in F1-score of 0.17 when a modality is missing during inference, demonstrating the benefit of training on multiple modalities.",,,Diagnosis,Activities of Daily Living,"Wearable, Video",,,,s21124133,Article,

Together with non-motor symptoms, other important signs of disease can be retrieved from the measurement of the movement trajectory and from tremor appearances. To measure these signs, the paper proposes a magnetic tracking system able to collect information about translational and vibrational movements in a spatial cubic domain, using a low-cost, low-power and highly accurate solution. These features allow the usage of the proposed technology to realize a portable monitoring system, that may be operated at home or in general practices, enabling telemedicine and preventing saturation of large neurological centers. Validation is based on three tests: movement trajectory tracking, a rest tremor test and a finger tapping test. These tests are considered in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and are provided as case studies to prove the system's capabilities to track and detect tremor frequencies. In the case of the tapping test, a preliminary classification scheme is also proposed to discriminate between healthy and ill patients. No human patients are involved in the tests, and most cases are emulated by means of a robotic arm, suitably driven to perform required tasks. Tapping test results show a classification accuracy of about 93% using a k-NN classification algorithm, while imposed tremor frequencies have been correctly detected by the system in the other two tests.",,,Diagnosis,"Tremor,Limb movements",magnetic tracking system,,,,s21124196,Article,

The method was designed to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and tremorogram data collected from patients with Parkinson's disease. The idea of the method of wave train electrical activity analysis is that we consider the biomedical signal as a combination of the wave trains. The wave train is the increase in the power spectral density of the signal localized in time, frequency, and space. We detect the wave trains as the local maxima in the wavelet spectrograms. We do not consider wave trains as a special kind of signal. The wave train analysis method is different from standard signal analysis methods such as Fourier analysis and wavelet analysis in the following way. Existing methods for analyzing EEG, EMG, and tremor signals, such as wavelet analysis, focus on local time-frequency changes in the signal and therefore do not reveal the generalized properties of the signal. Other methods such as standard Fourier analysis ignore the local time-frequency changes in the characteristics of the signal and, consequently, lose a large amount of information that existed in the signal. The method of wave train electrical activity analysis resolves the contradiction between these two approaches because it addresses the generalized characteristics of the biomedical signal based on local time-frequency changes in the signal. We investigate the following wave train parameters: wave train central frequency, wave train maximal power spectral density, wave train duration in periods, and wave train bandwidth. We have developed special graphical diagrams, named AUC diagrams, to determine what wave trains are characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we consider the following types of AUC diagrams: 2D and 3D diagrams. The technique of working with AUC diagrams is illustrated by examples of analysis of EMG in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers. It is demonstrated that new regularities useful for the high-accuracy diagnosis of Parkinson's disease can be revealed using the method of analyzing the wave train electrical activity and AUC diagrams.",,,Diagnosis,Tremor,BioPotential,,,,s21144700,Article,

Hence, noninvasive methods such as electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of PD patients can be an alternative biomarker. In this study, a deep-learning model is proposed for automated PD diagnosis. EEG recordings of 16 healthy controls and 15 PD patients were used for analysis. Using Gabor transform, EEG recordings were converted into spectrograms, which were used to train the proposed two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) model. As a result, the proposed model achieved high classification accuracy of 99.46% (Ã‚Â±0.73) for 3-class classification (healthy controls, and PD patients with and without medication) using tenfold cross-validation.

These techniques are not very reliable, particularly in the early stages of the disease. A novel detection and severity classification algorithm using deep learning approaches was developed in this research to classify the PD severity level based on vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) signals. Different variations in force patterns generated by the irregularity in vGRF signals due to the gait abnormalities of PD patients can indicate their severity. The main purpose of this research is to aid physicians in detecting early stages of PD, planning efficient treatment, and monitoring disease progression. The detection algorithm comprises preprocessing, feature transformation, and classification processes. In preprocessing, the vGRF signal is divided into 10, 15, and 30 s successive time windows. In the feature transformation process, the time domain vGRF signal in windows with varying time lengths is modified into a time-frequency spectrogram using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature enhancement. Finally, different types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed as deep learning classifiers for classification. The algorithm performance was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation (kfoldCV). The best average accuracy of the proposed detection algorithm in classifying the PD severity stage classification was 96.52% using ResNet-50 with vGRF data from the PhysioNet database.

Effect of Bout Length on Gait Measures in People with and without Parkinson's Disease during Daily Life,"Shah, Vrutangkumar; McNames, James; Harker, Graham; Mancini, Martina; Carlson-Kuhta, Patricia; Nutt, John; El-Gohary, Mahmoud; Curtze, Carolin; Horak, Fay",2020,Sensors,mobility; Parkinson's disease; bout length; wearable sensors; daily life,"Although the use of wearable technology to characterize gait disorders in daily life is increasing, there is no consensus on which specific gait bout length should be used to characterize gait. Clinical trialists using daily life gait quality as study outcomes need to understand how gait bout length affects the sensitivity and specificity of measures to discriminate pathological gait as well as the reliability of gait measures across gait bout lengths. We investigated whether Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) affects how gait characteristics change as bout length changes, and how gait bout length affects the reliability and discriminative ability of gait measures to identify gait impairments in people with PD compared to neurotypical Old Adults (OA). We recruited 29 people with PD and 20 neurotypical OA of similar age for this study. Subjects wore 3 inertial sensors, one on each foot and one over the lumbar spine all day, for 7 days. To investigate which gait bout lengths should be included to extract gait measures, we determined the range of gait bout lengths available across all subjects. To investigate if the effect of bout length on each gait measure is similar or not between subjects with PD and OA, we used a growth curve analysis. For reliability and discriminative ability of each gait measure as a function of gait bout length, we used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and area under the curve (AUC), respectively. Ninety percent of subjects walked with a bout length of less than 53 strides during the week, and the majority (&gt;50%) of gait bouts consisted of less than 12 strides. Although bout length affected all gait measures, the effects depended on the specific measure and sometimes differed for PD versus OA. Specifically, people with PD did not increase/decrease cadence and swing duration with bout length in the same way as OA. ICC and AUC characteristics tended to be larger for shorter than longer gait bouts. Our findings suggest that PD interferes with the scaling of cadence and swing duration with gait bout length. Whereas control subjects gradually increased cadence and decreased swing duration as bout length increased, participants with PD started with higher than normal cadence and shorter than normal stride duration for the smallest bouts, and cadence and stride duration changed little as bout length increased, so differences between PD and OA disappeared for the longer bout lengths. Gait measures extracted from shorter bouts are more common, more reliable, and more discriminative, suggesting that shorter gait bouts should be used to extract potential digital biomarkers for people with PD.",,,Diagnosis,"Gait,Limb movements",Wearable,,,,s20205769,Article,
Exploring the Predictors of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder for Parkinson's Disease Patients Using Classifier Ensemble,"Byeon, Haewon",2020,Healthcare,Parkinson's disease dementia; cognitive function; rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; random forest; RBF artificial neural network; neuropsychological profile,"The rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) patients can be improved with medications such as donepezil as long as it is diagnosed with a thorough medical examination, since identifying a high-risk group of RBD is a critical issue to treat PD. This study develops a model for predicting the high-risk groups of RBD using random forest (RF) and provides baseline information for selecting subjects for polysomnography. Subjects consisted of 350 PD patients (Parkinson&rsquo;s disease with normal cognition (PD-NC) = 48; Parkinson&rsquo;s disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) = 199; Parkinson&rsquo;s disease dementia (PDD) = 103) aged 60 years and older. This study compares the prediction performance of RF, discriminant analysis, classification and regression tree (CART), radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and logistic regression model to select a final model with the best model performance and presents the variable importance of the final model&rsquo;s variable. As a result of analysis, the sensitivity of RF (79%) was superior to other models (discriminant analysis = 14%, CART = 32%, RBF neural network = 25%, and logistic regression = 51%). It was confirmed that age, the motor score of Untitled Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Rating (UPDRS), the total score of UPDRS, the age when a subject was diagnosed with PD first time, the Korean Mini Mental State Examination, and Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, were major variables with high weight for predicting RBD. Among them, age was the most important factor. The model for predicting Parkinson&rsquo;s disease RBD developed in this study will contribute to the screening of patients who should receive a video-polysomnography.",,,Diagnosis,"Sleep topics,Dementia",Video Recording,,,,healthcare8020121,Article,

In this work, a wearable system composed of four inertial devices (two SensHand and two SensFoot), and related processing algorithms for extracting parameters from limbs motion was tested on 40 healthy subjects and 40 PD patients. Seventy-eight and 96 kinematic parameters were measured from lower and upper limbs, respectively. Statistical and correlation analysis allowed to define four datasets that were used to train and test five supervised learning classifiers. Excellent discrimination between the two groups was obtained with all the classifiers (average accuracy ranging from 0.936 to 0.960) and all the datasets (average accuracy ranging from 0.953 to 0.966), over three conditions that included parameters derived from lower, upper or all limbs. The best performances (accuracy = 1.00) were obtained when classifying all the limbs with linear support vector machine (SVM) or gaussian SVM.

This characteristic is inevitable, and can affect the quality of life of the patients. However, it is difficult to collect precise data on the fluctuation characteristics using self-reported data from PD patients. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a suitable technology that can detect the medication state, also termed the &ldquo;On&rdquo;/&ldquo;Off&rdquo; state, automatically using wearable devices; at the same time, this could be used in the home environment. Recently, wearable devices, in combination with powerful machine learning techniques, have shown the potential to be effectively used in critical healthcare applications. In this study, an algorithm is proposed that can detect the medication state automatically using wearable gait signals. A combination of features that include statistical features and spatiotemporal gait features are used as inputs to four different classifiers such as random forest, support vector machine, K nearest neighbour, and Na&iuml;ve Bayes. In total, 20 PD subjects with definite motor fluctuations have been evaluated by comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm in association with the four aforementioned classifiers.

Evaluation of Vertical Ground Reaction Forces Pattern Visualization in Neurodegenerative Diseases Identification Using Deep Learning and Recurrence Plot Image Feature Extraction,"Lin, Che-Wei; Wen, Tzu-Chien; Setiawan, Febryan",2020,Sensors,gait analysis; pattern visualization; neurodegenerative diseases; deep learning; feature extraction; recurrence plot; vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) data,"To diagnose neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), physicians have been clinically evaluating symptoms. However, these symptoms are not very dependable&mdash;particularly in the early stages of the diseases. This study has therefore proposed a novel classification algorithm that uses a deep learning approach to classify NDDs based on the recurrence plot of gait vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) data. The irregular gait patterns of NDDs exhibited by vGRF data can indicate different variations of force patterns compared with healthy controls (HC). The classification algorithm in this study comprises three processes: a preprocessing, feature transformation and classification. In the preprocessing process, the 5-min vGRF data divided into 10-s successive time windows. In the feature transformation process, the time-domain vGRF data are modified into an image using a recurrence plot. The total recurrence plots are 1312 plots for HC (16 subjects), 1066 plots for ALS (13 patients), 1230 plots for PD (15 patients) and 1640 plots for HD (20 subjects). The principal component analysis (PCA) is used in this stage for feature enhancement. Lastly, the convolutional neural network (CNN), as a deep learning classifier, is employed in the classification process and evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Gait data from HC subjects and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD) and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) obtained from the PhysioNet Gait Dynamics in Neurodegenerative disease were used to validate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results included two-class and multiclass classifications. In the two-class classification, the results included classification of the NDD and the HC groups and classification among the NDDs. The classification accuracy for (HC vs. ALS), (HC vs. HD), (HC vs. PD), (ALS vs. PD), (ALS vs. HD), (PD vs. HD) and (NDDs vs. HC) were 100%, 98.41%, 100%, 95.95%, 100%, 97.25% and 98.91%, respectively. In the multiclass classification, a four-class gait classification among HC, ALS, PD and HD was conducted and the classification accuracy of HC, ALS, PD and HD were 98.99%, 98.32%, 97.41% and 96.74%, respectively. The proposed method can achieve high accuracy compare to the existing results, but with shorter length of input signal (Input of existing literature using the same database is 5-min gait signal, but the proposed method only needs 10-s gait signal).",,,Diagnosis,Gait analysis,Force/Pressure,,,,s20143857,Article,

METHODS: A sample of 15 patients without cognitive impairment (PD-WCI), 15 with MCI (PD-MCI), and 26 healthy subjects were studied. The EEG was performed in the waking functional state with eyes closed, for the functional analysis it was used the synchronization likelihood (SL) and graph theory (GT). RESULTS: PD-MCI patients showed decreased FC in frequencies alpha, in posterior regions, and delta with a generalized distribution. Patients, compared to the healthy people, presented a decrease in segregation (lower clustering coefficient in alpha p = 0.003 in PD-MCI patients) and increased integration (shorter mean path length in delta (p = 0.004) and theta (p = 0.002) in PD-MCI patients). There were no significant differences in the network topology between the parkinsonian groups. In PD-MCI patients, executive dysfunction correlated positively with global connectivity in beta (r = 0.47) and negatively with the mean path length at beta (r = Ã¢Ë†â€™0.45); alterations in working memory were negatively correlated with the mean path length at beta r = Ã¢Ë†â€™0.45. CONCLUSIONS: PD patients present alterations in the FC in all frequencies, those with MCI show less connectivity in the alpha and delta frequencies. The neural networks of the patients show a random topology, with a similar organization between patients with and without MCI.

Feature Selection for Machine Learning Based Step Length Estimation Algorithms,"Vandermeeren, Stef; Bruneel, Herwig; Steendam, Heidi",2020,Sensors,machine learning; feature selection; IMU,"An accurate step length estimation can provide valuable information to different applications such as indoor positioning systems or it can be helpful when analyzing the gait of a user, which can then be used to detect various gait impairments that lead to a reduced step length (caused by e.g., Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or multiple sclerosis). In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the step length using machine learning techniques that could be used in an indoor positioning system. Previous step length algorithms tried to model the length of a step based on measurements from the accelerometer and some tuneable (user-specific) parameters. Machine-learning-based step length estimation algorithms eliminate these parameters to be tuned. Instead, to adapt these algorithms to different users, it suffices to provide examples of the length of multiple steps for different persons to the machine learning algorithm, so that in the training phase the algorithm can learn to predict the step length for different users. Until now, these machine learning algorithms were trained with features that were chosen intuitively. In this paper, we consider a systematic feature selection algorithm to be able to determine the features from a large collection of features, resulting in the best performance. This resulted in a step length estimator with a mean absolute error of 3.48 cm for a known test person and 4.19 cm for an unknown test person, while current state-of-the-art machine-learning-based step length estimators resulted in a mean absolute error of 4.94 cm and 6.27 cm for respectively a known and unknown test person.",,,Diagnosis,Gait analysis,Wearable,,,,s20030778,Article,

The Strengthening the Reporting of observational studies in Epidemiology Statement (STROBE) checklist for observational studies was used to assess the methodological rigor of the included studies. Thirty-six studies were included. Rigidity was quantitatively assessed in three ways, using servomotors, inertial sensors, and biomechanical and neurophysiological study of muscles. All methods showed good validity and reliability, good correlation with clinical scales, and were useful for detecting rigidity and studying its evolution. People with PD exhibit higher values in terms of objective muscle stiffness than healthy controls. Rigidity depends on the angular velocity and articular amplitude of the mobilization applied.

For the scoring protocol, the U-Net was trained with 199 PDT hand-drawn images of 512 &times; 512 resolution obtained via the mPDT in order to generate a trained model, Deep5, for segmenting a drawn right or left pentagon. The U-Net was also trained with 199 images of 512 &times; 512 resolution to attain the trained model, DeepLock, for segmenting an interlocking figure. Here, the epochs were iterated until the accuracy was greater than 98% and saturated. The mobile senor data primarily consisted of x and y coordinates, timestamps, and touch-events of all the samples with a 20 ms sampling period. The velocities were then calculated using the primary sensor data. With Deep5, DeepLock, and the sensor data, four parameters were extracted. These included the number of angles (0&ndash;4 points), distance/intersection between the two drawn figures (0&ndash;4 points), closure/opening of the drawn figure contours (0&ndash;2 points), and tremors detected (0&ndash;1 points). The parameters gave a scaling of 11 points in total. The performance evaluation for the mPDT included 230 images from subjects and their associated sensor data. The results of the performance test indicated, respectively, a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision of 97.53%, 92.62%, 94.35%, and 87.78% for the number of angles parameter; 93.10%, 97.90%, 96.09%, and 96.43% for the distance/intersection parameter; 94.03%, 90.63%, 92.61%, and 93.33% for the closure/opening parameter; and 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 100.00% for the detected tremor parameter.

NDD could cause gait abnormalities so that to screen NDD using gait signal is feasible. The research aim of this study is to develop an NDD classification algorithm via gait force (GF) using multiscale sample entropy (MSE) and machine learning models. The Physionet NDD gait database is utilized to validate the proposed algorithm. In the preprocessing stage of the proposed algorithm, new signals were generated by taking one and two times of differential on GF and are divided into various time windows (10/20/30/60-sec). In feature extraction, the GF signal is used to calculate statistical and MSE values.

However, the challenges that the researchers are facing with decision forests is identifying the minimum number of decision trees required to achieve maximum detection accuracy with the lowest error rate. This article examines two recent decision forest algorithms Systematically Developed Forest (SysFor), and Decision Forest by Penalizing Attributes (ForestPA) along with the popular Random Forest to design three distinct Parkinson&rsquo;s detection schemes with optimum number of decision trees. The proposed approach undertakes minimum number of decision trees to achieve maximum detection accuracy.

The incremental tree densities with dynamic training and testing of decision forests proved to be a better approach for detection of PD. The proposed approaches are examined along with other state-of-the-art classifiers including the modern deep learning techniques to observe the detection capability.

Among the three proposed detection schemes the Forest by Penalizing Attributes (ForestPA) proved to be a promising Parkinson&rsquo;s disease detector with a little number of decision trees in the forest to score the highest detection accuracy of 94.12% to 95.00%.",,,Diagnosis,Speech topics,,,,,app11020581,Article,
Muscular activation changes in lower limbs after underwater gait training in Parkinson's disease: A surface emg pilot study,"Volpe D,Spolaor F,Sawacha Z,Guiotto A,Pavan D,Bakdounes L,Urbani V,Frazzitta G,Iansek R",2020,Gait & Posture,"Parkinson disease, Surface EMG, Hydrotherapy, Gait analysis","Background Under water gait training (UT) has been proposed as an innovative rehabilitative strategy for the treatment of axial disorders in Parkinson Disease (PD) patients, in particular for balance and gait impairment. However, the basis for the improvement is unclear. Research question The aim of this study was to evaluate improvements in the muscular activation in the lower limbs in a cohort of PD patients after UT. Methods Ten PD participants in the""off""Ã‚Â state and 10 controls (mean ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± standard deviation of age and BMI were respectively: 71 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 6 years, 28 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 3 kg/m2; 65.5 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 7 years, 28 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 3 kg/m2) were enrolled in the study. After signing informed consent, they walked barefoot at their preferred speed on a 10 m walkway, before and after UT. The electrical activity of four muscles were collected bilaterally by means of a surface electromyography system (sEMG), two force plates and a motion capture system. All signals were synchronized in time with the gait cycle. The sEMG activity of Rectus Femoris (RF), Tibialis Anterior (TA), Biceps Femoris (BF) and Gastrocnemius Lateralis (GL) were acquired. The average from each signal was used to extract the peak of the Envelope (PoE) and its occurrence with respect to the gait cycle (PoPE%). Time and space parameters were determined. Results Our results showed that UT in PD patients improved the muscle's recruitment pattern towards normal. The PD patients POPE% was comparable with the one of the controls (TA: 20-35 %, 75-80 % of gait cycle; GL: 0-15 %, 25-45 %, 85-100 % of gait cycle) after UT on each muscle with the exception of BF. The muscle co-activation plots failed to show improvement in line with the muscle activation. Significance These results suggest that the muscle activation improvement with UT in PD participants might be due to a reorganisation at the executive rather than at the command level.",10<n<=20,Laboratory,Predicting Response to Treatment,Gait,BioPotential,,EMG,,j.gaitpost.2020.03.017,Journal Article,

Methods Thirty individuals were evaluated with the RUNZIÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â® app and with the 10-meter walking test (10 MW), simultaneously. In addition, the Timed Up & Go test (TUG), Tinetti scale, and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) were used to study the construct validity.

Results The correlation indices of the 10 MW test with the RUNZIÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â® app at fast speeds was moderate to excellent (r = .588-.957). At a comfortable speed, the correlation was excellent for walking speed (r = 0.944), moderate for steps (r = 0.780) and stride length (r = 0.760), and poor for cadence (r = .424). Results showed significant correlations between TUG and spatio-temporal gait parameters at fast and comfortable speeds. There were no significant correlations or consistent associations between Tinetti and BBS and RUNZIÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â®. The test-retest reliability was good to excellent for parameters measured with the RUNZIÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â®.

Here, eight patients suffering from the Parkinson's diseases are invited for performing the investigation. The patients wear the wearable devices before and after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy for acquiring the corresponding resting tremor signals. First, the DC means of these signals are removed. Then, these zero mean signals are normalized to the unit energy signals. Second, the singular spectrum analysis is performed and the sets of singular spectrum analysis components are obtained. Next, the singular spectrum analysis components corresponding to the voluntary movements and the noises from various sources are removed. Third, the fast Fourier transforms are computed on the sums of the rest of singular spectrum analysis components. Then, the signal components between 3 Hz and 8 Hz are extracted out. Next, the energies of the signal components are computed for performing the analysis. The computer numerical simulation results show that the energies of the tremors after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy are lower than those before applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy for all these eight patients. Compare to the processing without performing the singular spectrum analysis, the energies of the tremors after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy are lower than those before applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy only for seven patients. This verifies that the singular spectrum analysis approach is effective for performing the analysis and the bio-electronic stimulation therapy is effective for suppressing the syndromes of the Parkinson's diseases.",<=10,Laboratory,Predicting Response to Treatment,Tremor,Wearable,,Accelerometer,50Hz,j.bspc.2020.102131,Journal Article,

Motor effects of deep brain stimulation correlate with increased functional connectivity in Parkinson's disease: An MEG study,"Boon LI,Hillebrand A,Potters WV,de Bie RM,Prent N,Bot M,Schuurman PR,Stam CJ,van Rootselaar AF,Berendse HW",2020,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Parkinson's disease, Magnetoencephalography, Deep brain stimulation, Motor symptoms, Resting-state","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established symptomatic treatment in Parkinson's disease, yet its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Locally in the STN, stimulation lowers beta band power, in parallel with symptom relief. Therefore, beta band oscillations are sometimes referred to as""anti-kinetic""Ã‚Â. However, in recent studies functional interactions have been observed beyond the STN, which we hypothesized to reflect clinical effects of DBS. Resting-state, whole-brain magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and assessments on motor function were obtained in 18 Parkinson's disease patients with bilateral STN-DBS, on and off stimulation. For each brain region, we estimated source-space spectral power and functional connectivity with the rest of the brain. Stimulation led to an increase in average peak frequency and a suppression of absolute band power (delta to low-beta band) in the sensorimotor cortices. Significant changes (decreases and increases) in low-beta band functional connectivity were observed upon stimulation. Improvement in bradykinesia/rigidity was significantly related to increases in alpha2 and low-beta band functional connectivity (of sensorimotor regions, the cortex as a whole, and subcortical regions). By contrast, tremor improvement did not correlate with changes in functional connectivity. Our results highlight the distributed effects of DBS on the resting-state brain and suggest that DBS-related improvements in rigidity and bradykinesia, but not tremor, may be mediated by an increase in alpha2 and low-beta functional connectivity. Beyond the local effects of DBS in and around the STN, functional connectivity changes in these frequency bands might therefore be considered as""pro-kinetic""Ã‚Â.",10<n<=20,Laboratory,Predicting Response to Treatment,Nerve/Brain signals,BioPotential,,MEG,1250 Hz,j.nicl.2020.102225,Journal Article,

Methods A fully automated ML pipeline was applied to 112 PD patients, taking EEG time-series as input and predicted class-labels as output. The most extreme cognitive scores were selected for class differentiation, i.e. best vs. worst cognitive performance (n = 20 per group). 16,674 features were extracted per patient; feature-selection was performed using a Boruta algorithm. A random forest classifier was modelled; 10-fold cross-validation with Bayesian optimization was performed to ensure generalizability.

Postoperative apathy cannot always be related to a dose reduction of dopaminergic medication and stimulation itself may play a role. Objective We studied whether apathy in DBS-treated PD patients could be a stimulation effect. Methods In 26 PD patients we acquired apathy scores before and >6 months after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Magnetoencephalography recordings (ON and OFF stimulation) were performed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â€Â°Ã‚Â¥6 months after DBS placement. Change in apathy severity was correlated with (i) improvement in motor function and dose reduction of dopaminergic medication, (ii) stimulation location (merged MRI and CT-scans) and (iii) stimulation-related changes in functional connectivity of brain regions that have an alleged role in apathy. Results Average apathy severity significantly increased after DBS (p < 0.001) and the number of patients considered apathetic increased from two to nine. Change in apathy severity did not correlate with improvement in motor function or dose reduction of dopaminergic medication. For the left hemisphere, increase in apathy was associated with a more dorsolateral stimulation location (p = 0.010). The increase in apathy severity correlated with a decrease in alpha1 functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p = 0.006), but not with changes of the medial orbitofrontal or the anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions The present observations suggest that apathy after STN-DBS is not necessarily related to dose reductions of dopaminergic medication, but may be an effect of the stimulation itself.

However, while many of the motoric features of Parkinson's disease (e.g. bradykinesia, rigidity, hypomimia) correlate well with reduced striatal dopamine transporter binding, the same relationship has not been demonstrated for tremor. We investigated the relationship between striatal dopamine transporter binding and quantitative measures of tremor. Methods 23 participants with Parkinson's disease underwent standardised clinical assessment including structured, videotaped clinical examination, tremor neurophysiology study of both upper limbs using accelerometry and surface EMG, and Technitium-99 m TRODAT-1 brain SPECT imaging. Normalised striatal uptake values were calculated. Tremor EMG and accelerometry time series were processed with Fourier transformation to identify peak tremor power within a window of 3-10Hz and to calculate the tremor stability index (TSI). Results Spearman correlation analyses revealed an association between tremor power and contralaterally reduced striatal uptake in a number of recording conditions. This association was strongest for rest tremor, followed by postural tremor, with the weakest association observed for kinetic tremor. Lower TSI was also associated with lower contralateral striatal uptake in a number of rest and postural conditions. Conclusion These data suggest a relationship between Parkinsonian rest tremor and contralateral reduction in striatal dopamine binding. Use of quantitative neurophysiology techniques may allow the demonstration of clinico-pathophysiological relationships in tremor that have remained occult to previous studies.",20<n<=30,Laboratory,Predicting Response to Treatment,Tremor,Video Recording,,,,j.parkreldis.2021.03.003,Journal Article,
Discrimination of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and vascular parkinsonism based on gait time series and the levodopa effect,"Fernandes C,Ferreira F,Lopes RL,Bicho E,Erlhagen W,Sousa N,Gago MF",2021,Journal of Biomechanics,"Stride time series, Multiple regression models, Convolutional neural networks, Idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Vascular parkinsonism","Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and vascular parkinsonism (VaP) present highly overlapping phenotypes, making it challenging to distinguish between these two parkinsonian syndromes. Recent evidence suggests that gait assessment and response to levodopa medication may assist in the objective evaluation of clinical differences. In this paper, we propose a new approach for gait pattern differentiation that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on gait time series with and without the influence of levodopa medication. Wearable sensors positioned on both feet were used to acquire gait data from 14 VaP patients, 15 IPD patients, and 34 healthy subjects. An individual's gait features are affected by physical characteristics, including age, height, weight, sex, and walking speed or stride length. Therefore, to reduce bias due to intersubject variations, a multiple regression normalization approach was used to obtain gait data. Recursive feature elimination using the linear support vector machine, lasso, and random forest were applied to infer the optimal feature subset that led to the best results. CNNs were implemented by means of various hyperparameters and feature subsets. The best CNN classifiers achieved accuracies of 79.33%ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â±6.46, 82.33%ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â±10.62, and 86.00%ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â±7.12 without (off state), with (on state), and with the simultaneous consideration of the effect of levodopa medication (off/on state), respectively. The response to levodopa medication improved classification performance. Based on gait time series and response to medication, the proposed approach differentiates between IPD and VaP gait patterns and reveals a high accuracy rate, which might prove useful when distinguishing other diseases related to Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias.",10<n<=20,Laboratory,Predicting Response to Treatment,Gait,Wearable,,,,j.jbiomech.2020.110214,Journal Article,

The Parkinson's Kinetigraph (PKG) is a wearable device which generates tremor, bradykinesia (BKS) and dyskinesia (DKS) scores representing motor symptoms over a six-day period. In this study, we compared off/on testing with PKG motor scores. Methods Patients were enrolled as part of an observational study: Assessing the Longitudinal Signs in PD, a three-year study evaluating clinical and biomarker evolution in patients with PD taking levodopa. Patients underwent off/on testing at baseline and 6-month visits. A greater than 30% improvement between off and on MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores was considered a robust response. After each visit, patients wore the PKG for 6 days. A bradykinesia score (BKS) greater than 26 and dyskinesia score (DKS) greater than 9 were considered poorly controlled bradykinesia and dyskinesia, respectively. Results The median BKS at the baseline and 6-month visits were 27.15 and 27.55, respectively, despite a robust median off/on improvement at both visits. In addition, 10/18 (66%) and 7/13 (53.8%) patients with robust off/on improvement at the baseline and 6-month visits, respectively, demonstrated a BKS > 26 or DKS > 9. Conclusion A robust off/on response during a clinic visit does not necessarily reflect adequately controlled motor symptoms.

Several patients, however, fall within the first three years of disease, particularly when turning. We investigated whether PD patients, without clinically overt PI, manifest abnormal reactive postural responses to ecological perturbations resembling turning. Methods Fifteen healthy subjects and 20 patients without clinically overt PI, under and not under L-Dopa, underwent dynamic posturography during axial rotations around the longitudinal axis, provided by a robotic mechatronic platform. We measured reactive postural responses, including body displacement and reciprocal movements of the head, trunk, and pelvis, by using a network of three wearable inertial sensors. Results Patients showed higher body displacement of the head, trunk and pelvis, and lower joint movements at the lumbo-sacral junction than controls. Conversely, movements at the cranio-cervical junction were normal in PD. L-Dopa left reactive postural responses unchanged. Conclusions Patients with PD without clinically overt PI manifest abnormal reactive postural responses to axial rotations, unresponsive to L-Dopa.

Smartwatches allow for inexpensive, unobtrusive, and continuous HR estimation for potential detection of treatment effects outside the clinic, during daily life. The aim of this study is to evaluate the repeatability and sensitivity of smartwatch-based HR estimates collected during a randomized clinical trial. The data were collected as part of a multiple-dose, investigator-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 12 patients with Parkinson disease. After a 6-day baseline period, 4 and 8 patients were treated for 7 days with an ascending dose of placebo and clenbuterol, respectively. Throughout the study, the smartwatch provided HR and sleep state estimates. The HR estimates were quantified as the 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentiles within awake and asleep segments. Linear mixed models were used to calculate the following: (1) the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of estimated sleep durations, (2) the ICC and minimum detectable effect (MDE) of the HR estimates, and (3) the effect sizes of the HR estimates. Sleep duration was moderately repeatable (ICC=0.64) and was not significantly affected by study day ( P =.83), clenbuterol ( P =.43), and study day by clenbuterol ( P =.73). Clenbuterol-induced changes were detected in the asleep HR as of the first night (+3.79 beats per minute [bpm], P =.04) and in the awake HR as of the third day (+8.79 bpm, P =.001). The median HR while asleep had the highest repeatability (ICC=0.70). The MDE (N=12) was found to be smaller when patients were asleep (6.8 bpm to 11.7 bpm) than while awake (10.7 bpm to 22.1 bpm). Overall, the effect sizes for clenbuterol-induced changes were higher while asleep (0.49 to 2.75) than while awake (0.08 to 1.94). We demonstrated the feasibility of using smartwatch-based HR estimates to detect clenbuterol-induced changes during clinical trials. The asleep HR estimates were most repeatable and sensitive to treatment effects. We conclude that smartwatch-based HR estimates obtained during daily living in a clinical trial can be used to detect and track treatment effects.

These fluctuations significantly impair the quality of life of many Parkinsonâ€™s patients. However, current clinical evaluation tools are not designed for the continuous, naturalistic (real-world) symptom monitoring needed to optimize clinical therapy to treat fluctuations. Although commercially available wearable motor monitoring, used over multiple days, can augment neurological decision making, the feasibility of rapid and dynamic detection of motor fluctuations is unclear. So far, applied wearable monitoring algorithms are trained on group data. In this study, we investigated the influence of individual model training on short timescale classification of naturalistic bradykinesia fluctuations in Parkinsonâ€™s patients using a single-wrist accelerometer. As part of the Parkinson@Home study protocol, 20 Parkinson patients were recorded with bilateral wrist accelerometers for a one hour OFF medication session and a one hour ON medication session during unconstrained activities in their own homes. Kinematic metrics were extracted from the accelerometer data from the bodyside with the largest unilateral bradykinesia fluctuations across medication states. The kinematic accelerometer features were compared over the 1 h duration of recording, and medication-state classification analyses were performed on 1 min segments of data. Then, we analyzed the influence of individual versus group model training, data window length, and total number of training patients included in group model training, on classification. Statistically significant areas under the curves (AUCs) for medication induced bradykinesia fluctuation classification were seen in 85% of the Parkinson patients at the single minute timescale using the group models. Individually trained models performed at the same level as the group trained models (mean AUC both 0.70, standard deviation respectively 0.18 and 0.10) despite the small individual training dataset. AUCs of the group models improved as the length of the feature windows was increased to 300 s, and with additional training patient datasets. We were able to show that medication-induced fluctuations in bradykinesia can be classified using wrist-worn accelerometry at the time scale of a single minute. Rapid, naturalistic Parkinson motor monitoring has the clinical potential to evaluate dynamic symptomatic and therapeutic fluctuations and help tailor treatments on a fast timescale.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia,Wearable,,IMU,,s21237876,research-article,

Imperative for the efficacy of deep brain stimulation is the quantification of therapeutic response. The implementation of inertial sensor systems has considerably augmented the acuity of quantifying the characteristics of the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia through the respective signal data. For example, these inertial sensors constitute effectively wearable and wireless systems that can be mounted about the dorsum of the hand to objectively quantify tremor. Using machine learning algorithms considerable classification accuracy has been achieved. Conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor systems have been recently developed that can be conveniently mounted about the dorsum of the hand by an adhesive medium with a profile on the order of a bandage. Additionally, these conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor systems can have their data wirelessly transmitted to a secure Cloud computing environment. This capability offers the opportunity to ascertain the inertial sensor signal for Parkinson's disease tremor response in the context of multiple deep brain stimulation parameter configurations, such as an assortment of amplitude settings. The objective of the research was to quantify and distinguish the response of Parkinson's disease tremor through an assortment of amplitude settings for deep brain stimulation, such as `Off' setting as a baseline, amplitude set to 1.0 mA, amplitude set to 1.75 mA, amplitude set to 2.5 mA, amplitude set to 3.25 mA, and amplitude set to 4.0 mA, using a deep learning convolutional neural network through TensorFlow with the quantification of tremor by a conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system.

Phase-Dependent Effects of Closed-Loop Tactile Feedback on Gait Stability in Parkinson's Disease,P. C. Fino; M. Mancini,2020,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,Cueing;dual-task;gait stability;Parkinson's disease;wearable sensors;Lyapunov exponents;accelerometers,"Gait disturbances in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) are a major cause for functional dependence and have recently been shown to be the largest risk factor for falls, institutionalization and death in PD. The use of external cues has been successful at improving gait in people with PD, but the effect of external cues on gait stability is unclear. We examined whether different forms of cueing, open-loop and closed-loop, influenced the local dynamic stability of three critical phases of gait. Forty-three adults with PD completed six, two-minute long walking trials in the following cued conditions: no cue (B), open-loop cueing, fixed auditory cue (OL), closed-loop cueing, tactile feedback delivered to wrist when the ipsilateral foot contacted with the ground (CL). Conditions were performed with and without a cognitive task. Kinematic data were recorded with inertial sensors. Only CL cueing was associated with changes in trunk stability, and these changes were only evident during the weight transfer phase of gait. Both OL and CL caused reductions in overall gait speed, stride length, and an increase in stride time. While CL cueing significantly influenced local dynamic stability during weight transfer, it remains unknown whether these changes are associated with more or less global stability. Future research will explore the clinical implications.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Gait,Wearable,,,,tnsre.2020.2997283,IEEE Journals,
Detecting Effect of Levodopa in Parkinson's Disease Patients Using Sustained Phonemes,N. D. Pah; M. A. Motin; P. Kempster; D. K. Kumar,2021,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,Dysarthria;drug response;Parkinson's disease;sustained phonemes;voice analysis,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-symptom neurodegenerative disease generally managed with medications, of which levodopa is the most effective. Determining the dosage of levodopa requires regular meetings where motor function can be observed. Speech impairment is an early symptom in PD and has been proposed for early detection and monitoring of the disease. However, findings from previous research on the effect of levodopa on speech have not shown a consistent picture. Method: This study has investigated the effect of medication on PD patients for three sustained phonemes; /a/, /o/, and /m/, which were recorded from 24 PD patients during medication <italic>off</italic> and <italic>on</italic> stages, and from 22 healthy participants. The differences were statistically investigated, and the features were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The results show that medication has a significant effect on the change of time and amplitude perturbation (jitter and shimmer) and harmonics of /m/, which was the most sensitive individual phoneme to the levodopa response. /m/ and /o/ performed at a comparable level in discriminating PD-<italic>off</italic> from control recordings. However, SVM classifications based on the combined use of the three phonemes /a/, /o/, and /m/ showed the best classifications, both for medication effect and for separating PD from control voice. The SVM classification for PD-<italic>off</italic> versus PD-<italic>on</italic> achieved an AUC of 0.81. Conclusion: Studies of phonation by computerized voice analysis in PD should employ recordings of multiple phonemes. Our findings are potentially relevant in research to identify early parkinsonian dysarthria, and to tele-monitoring of the levodopa response in patients with established PD.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,jtehm.2021.3066800,IEEE Journals,
An Adaptive ADRC Control for Parkinson's Patients Using Machine Learning,B. Faraji; M. Gheisarnejad; M. Yalsavar; M. -H. Khooban,2021,IEEE Sensors Journal,Deep brain stimulation (DBS);basal ganglia (BG);hand tremor;active disturbance rejection control (ADRC);deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG),"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common diseases that its main complications are hand and head tremors and inflexibility of muscles. One of the prevalent treatments that employ for reducing the symptoms of that is deep brain stimulation (DBS). In practice, a sensor is located in the patient's finger for detecting and evaluating the tremor values in PD. Using an open-loop control structure for stimulating one area of basal ganglia (BG) is the common approach, but in this work, two areas of BG, named subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internal (GPi) are stimulated in a closed-loop manner separately for i) reducing the intensity of electric field and consequently disappearing the side effects of DBS ii) decreasing hand tremor. In particular, an adaptive Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) based on a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and a conventional feedback controller are presented for simultaneous stimulating STN and GPi, respectively. In this way, the control coefficients of the ADRC are considered as the control objective parameters that are designed by the actor and critic neural networks (NNs) of DDPG. The suggested scheme is applied to a BG system model which is frequently studied in the literature. The comprehensive simulation studies are accomplished to confirm the supremacy of the ADRC based DDPG scheme over the state-of-the-art strategies. Moreover, hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulations are performed to verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme from real-time perspective.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,Tremor,Deep Brain Stimulation,,,,jsen.2020.3048588,IEEE Journals,

However, little attention has been given to the effects of different DBS stimulation frequencies on gait outcomes. Accordingly, the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of two different DBS stimulation frequencies (60 and 130 Hz) on gait spatio-temporal parameters, symmetry, smoothness, and variability in PD patients. The analysis concentrated on acceleration signals acquired by a magnetic inertial measurement unit placed on the trunk of participants. Sessions of gait were registered for three PD patients, three young and three elderly healthy subjects. Gait outcomes revealed a connection with both age and pathology. Values of the Harmonic Ratio (HR) estimated for the three-axis acceleration signals showed subjective effects provoked by DBS stimulation frequencies. Consequently, HR turned out to be suitable for depicting gait characteristics, but also as a monitoring parameter for the subjective adaptation of DBS stimulation frequency. Concerning the PoincarÃƒÂ© analysis of vertical acceleration signal, PD patients showed a greater dispersion of data compared to healthy subjects, but with negligible differences between the two stimulation frequencies.

Little,2021,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Gait modelling;health monitoring;passive monitoring;gait detection;wearable sensing,"Passive monitoring in daily life may provide valuable insights into a person's health throughout the day. Wearable sensor devices play a key role in enabling such monitoring in a non-obtrusive fashion. However, sensor data collected in daily life reflect multiple health and behavior-related factors together. This creates the need for a structured principled analysis to produce reliable and interpretable predictions that can be used to support clinical diagnosis and treatment. In this work we develop a principled modelling approach for free-living gait (walking) analysis. Gait is a promising target for non-obtrusive monitoring because it is common and indicative of many different Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias such as Parkinson's disease (PD), yet its analysis has largely been limited to experimentally controlled lab settings. To locate and characterize stationary gait segments in free-living using accelerometers, we present an unsupervised probabilistic framework designed to segment signals into differing gait and non-gait patterns. We evaluate the approach using a new video-referenced dataset including 25 PD patients with motor fluctuations and 25 age-matched controls, performing unscripted daily living activities in and around their own houses. Using this dataset, we demonstrate the framework's ability to detect gait and predict medication induced fluctuations in PD patients based on free-living gait. We show that our approach is robust to varying sensor locations, including the wrist, ankle, trouser pocket and lower back.",,,Predicting Response to Treatment,"Gait,Activities of Daily Living",Wearable,,,,jbhi.2020.3037857,IEEE Journals,
Multi-Modal and Multi-Scale Oral Diadochokinesis Analysis using Deep Learning,Y. Y. Wang; K. Gaol; A. Hamad; B. McCarthy; A. M. Kloepper; T. E. Lever; F. Bunyak,2021,2021 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR),Oral diadochokinesis;syllable detection;mouth/jaw motion;deep learning,"Various neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x0027;s disease (PD), stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), etc. cause oromotor dysfunctions resulting in significant speech and swallowing impairments. Assessment and monitoring of speech disorders offer effective and non-invasive opportunities for dif-ferential diagnosis and treatment monitoring of neurological disorders. Oral diadochokinesis (oral-DDK) is a widely used test conducted by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to assess speech impairments. Unfortunately, analysis of the oral-DDK tests relies on perceptual judgments by SLPs and are often sub-jective and qualitative, thus limiting their clinical value. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal oral-DDK test analysis system involving automated processing of complementary 1D audio and 2D video signals of both speech and swallowing function. The system aims to automatically generate objective and quantitative measures from the oral-DDK tests to aid early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of neurological disorders. The audio signal analysis component of the proposed system involves a novel multi-scale deep learning network. The video signal analysis component involves tracking mouth and jaw motion during speech tests using our visual landmark tracking software. The proposed system has been evaluated on speech files corresponding to 9 different DDK speech syllables. The experimental results demonstrate promising audio syllable detection performance with an average of 1.6 &#x0025; count error across different types of oral-DDK speech tasks.

The Personal KinetiGraph (TM) (PKG) and similar wearable sensors have shown promise in enabling objective, continuous remote health monitoring for Parkinson's patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose to use objective sensor data from the PKG and apply machine learning to cluster patients based on levodopa regimens and response. The resulting clusters are then used to enhance treatment planning by providing improved initial treatment estimates to supplement a physician's initial assessment. We apply k-means clustering to a dataset of within-subject Parkinson's medication changes-clinically assessed by the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (MDS-UPDRS-III) and the PKG sensor for movement staging. A random forest classification model was then used to predict patients' cluster allocation based on their respective demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data. Clinically relevant clusters were partitioned by levodopa dose, medication administration frequency, and total levodopa equivalent daily dose-with the PKG providing similar symptomatic assessments to physician MDS-UPDRS-III scores. A random forest classifier trained on demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data was able to accurately classify subjects of the two most demographically similar clusters with an accuracy of 86.9%, an F1 score of 90.7%, and an AUC of 0.871. A model that relied solely on demographic information and PKG time-series data provided the next best performance with an accuracy of 83.8%, an F1 score of 88.5%, and an AUC of 0.831, hence further enabling fully remote assessments.

In total, 25 persons performed a 40 s stepping in place task in front of a single RGBD camera (Kinect for Xbox One) in up to two different therapeutic states. Eight kinematic parameters were derived from knee movements to describe features of hypokinesia, asymmetry, and arrhythmicity of stepping. To explore their potential clinical utility, these parameters were analyzed for their Spearman&rsquo;s Rho rank correlation to clinical ratings, and for intraindividual changes between treatment conditions using standard response mean and paired t-test. Test performance not only differed between ON and OFF treatment conditions, but showed moderate correlations to clinical ratings, specifically ratings of postural instability (pull test).

Reliability of the slower and faster conditions between the estimated and measured speeds indicated excellent agreement for PD patients and controls. PD patients demonstrated higher gait asymmetry (GA) and coefficient of variance (CV) for stride length and stance phase than the controls at slower speeds and higher CVs for phases for single support, double support, and stance. CV of the double support phase could distinguish between PD patients and controls at faster speeds.

Time series analysis has been used here for the first time to study brain connectivity changes during motor activation in PD. Methods: A 64-channel EEG signal was registered during unilateral motor activation and resting-state in 6 non-demented PD patients before and after the administration of levodopa and in 6 matched healthy controls. Spectral entropy correlation, coherence, and interhemispheric divergence differences among PD patients and controls were analyzed under the assumption of stationarity of the time series. Results: During the motor activation test, PD patients showed an increased correlation coefficient (both hands p &lt; 0.001) and a remarkable increase in coherence in all frequency range compared to the generalized reduction observed in controls (both hands p &lt; 0.001). The Kullback&shy;&ndash;Leibler Divergence (KLD) of the Spectral Entropy between brain hemispheres was observed to increase in controls (right hand p = 0.01; left hand p = 0.015) and to decrease in PD patients (right hand p = 0.02; left hand p = 0.002) with motor activation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the oscillatory activity of the different cortex areas within healthy brains is relatively independent of the rest.

This is often reflected by an increased drop-out rate of PD patients in longitudinal studies. Active physical behavior can impact the disease course beneficially and has an overall positive effect on health. Contrarily, sedentary behavior is associated with cognitive impairment in PD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sedentary physical behavior assessed in the home environment and cognitive impairment can predict health-related study attrition due to sickness and death in PD. Methods Data of 45 PD patients, longitudinally assessed, were analyzed. Of those, 20 patients completed six yearly visits, 16 dropped out due to sickness or death, and nine for other reasons. All patients wore a mobile device to assess physical behavior and completed cognitive testing. Results Logistic regression revealed global cognition was the primary predictor for health-related drop-out in varying models (p ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â€Â°Ã‚Â¤ .04). In the survival analysis, cognitive impairment (p = .005) and longer sedentary mean bout length (p = .02) were associated with drop-out due to sickness and death. The occurrence of health-related study drop-out or death was highest in patients with both impaired cognition and longer sedentary bouts. Conclusions Cognition was the primary predictor for study drop-out due to sickness and death.

In this study, we explore the possibility that multiple brain network responses are associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment in PD. This association is likely to provide insights into a single multivariate relationship, where common affective symptoms occurring in PD cohorts are related with alterations to electrophysiological response. Methods 70 PD patients and 21 healthy age-matched controls (HC) participated in a high-density electroencephalography (EEG) study. Functional connectivity differences between PD and HC groups of oscillatory activity at rest and during completion of an emotion-cognition task were examined to identify key brain oscillatory activities. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied to identify a putative multivariate relationship between connectivity patterns and affective symptoms in PD groups. Results A CCA analysis identified a single mode of co-variation linking theta and gamma connectivity with affective symptoms in PD groups. Increases in frontotemporal gamma, frontal and parietal theta connectivity were related with increased anxiety and cognitive impairment. Decreases in temporal region theta and frontoparietal gamma connectivity were associated with higher depression ratings and PD patient age.

Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was compared between groups in the ÃƒÂŽÃ‚Â± (8ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™14 Hz), low-ÃƒÂƒÃ…Â¸ (14ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™20 Hz), and high-ÃƒÂƒÃ…Â¸ (20ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™35 Hz) frequency bands to investigate between-group differences in the cortical activities associated with movement. Average kinematic peak amplitudes and latencies were extracted alongside Sample Entropy (SaEn), a measure of signal complexity, as variables for comparison between groups. These variables were further correlated with average EEG power in each frequency band to establish within-group interactions between cortical motor functions and kinematic motor output. High ÃƒÂƒÃ…Â¸-band power correlated with mean kinematic peak latency and signal complexity in the healthy group, while no correlation was found in the PD group. Also, the healthy group demonstrated stronger ERD in the broad ÃƒÂƒÃ…Â¸-band than the PD participants.

Methods: We measured the short-latency electromyography (EMG) reflex effects of brief impulsive displacements applied to the upper sternum or C7 for tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus. Our subjects were studied standing normally and when leaning both forwards and backwards. Results The initial mechanical effects of the stimuli were similar but the reflex responses for the unstable PD group were increased, even after allowing for the increased levels of tonic activation. For TA, unstable PD subjects had significantly larger responses than the stable PD group whose responses were in turn significantly larger than controls. For soleus, unstable PD subjects had significantly greater responses than controls. Conclusions These findings are consistent with previous evidence that exaggerated postural responses are characteristic of unstable PD subjects.

Research question We investigated the footsteps, walking trajectories, and spatiotemporal parameters during the TUG in PD, healthy older (HO), and healthy young (HY) subjects and the associations between the parameters of footsteps or walking trajectories and the spatiotemporal parameters during turning. Methods Twenty-six PD, 20 HO, and 20 HY subjects participated. They performed the TUG at self-selected speed and underwent evaluations of spatiotemporal parameters in the forward, turning, and return phases and parameters of footsteps and walking trajectories by a system using laser range sensors to measure the two-dimensional distance data of the legs. Foot placement for each foot was measured as the estimated position when the leg speed of movement reached the minimum between foot-contact and foot-off. We calculated the minimum distance from a TUG marker to footsteps and the maximum anterior distance from the start to the footsteps. Step length was calculated using a method for non-linear walking. Results The PD subjects showed significantly smaller step lengths in all phases. The minimum distance from the marker to the footsteps in PD subjects was significantly smaller than in HO subjects and was significantly positively correlated only with the turning-phase step length. The maximum anterior distance from the start to footsteps in HO subjects was significantly larger than in PD and HY subjects and was not correlated with any spatiotemporal parameters. Significance This study demonstrated that people with PD turn close to the TUG marker, and this turning strategy may be associated with the decreased step length when turning. These findings could help in providing instructions which prevent the exaggeration of step-length reduction when turning.",10<n<=20,Laboratory,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Other,,Laser sonsor,,j.gaitpost.2021.06.021,Journal Article,

The severity of PD motor impairments is clinically assessed by part III of the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), a universally-accepted rating scale. However, experts often disagree on the exact scoring of individuals. In the presence of label noise, training a machine learning model using only scores from a single rater may introduce bias, while training models with multiple noisy ratings is a challenging task due to the inter-rater variabilities. In this paper, we introduce an ordinal focal neural network to estimate the MDS-UPDRS scores from input videos, to leverage the ordinal nature of MDS-UPDRS scores and combat class imbalance. To handle multiple noisy labels per exam, the training of the network is regularized via rater confusion estimation (RCE), which encodes the rating habits and skills of raters via a confusion matrix. We apply our pipeline to estimate MDS-UPDRS test scores from their video recordings including gait (with multiple Raters, R=3) and finger tapping scores (single rater). On a sizable clinical dataset for the gait test (N=55), we obtained a classification accuracy of 72% with majority vote as ground-truth, and an accuracy of ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã‚Â¼84% of our model predicting at least one of the raters' scores.

Design Cross-sectional study. Participants were instructed to keep 2 interlocking rings apart and maintain balance in a tandem stance. Attention was focused on either stance stability (posture-focus strategy) or the interlocking rings (supraposture-focus strategy). Setting University research laboratory. Participants Fifteen patients with PD and less postural impairment and 15 patients with PD and more postural impairment (N=30). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Postural sway, postural determinism (%DET), ankle co-contraction, and ring-touching time. Results In the less-impairment group, the supraposture-focus strategy provided smaller postural sway and postural %DET compared with the posture-focus strategy. In the more-impairment group, task prioritization showed lower effect on both postural sway and postural %DET. The supraposture-focus strategy led to less ankle co-contraction than the posture-focus strategy in the more-impairment group, but task prioritization did not affect ankle co-contraction in the less-impairment group. In both groups, the supraposture-focus strategy led to less ring-touching time than the posture-focus strategy. Conclusions The supraposture-focus strategy provided better dual-task control than the posture-focus strategy in both PD groups. In the less-impairment group, the supraposture-focus strategy enhanced postural automaticity and postural stability. In the more-impairment group, the supraposture-focus strategy reduced ankle stiffness, owing to reduced muscle co-contraction.",10<n<=20,Laboratory,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Posture,BioPotential,,EMG,,j.apmr.2020.02.014,Journal Article,

Hence, this paper has provided a new cost-effective approach based on time-varying singular value decomposition method for the analysis of gait signals. The main idea is to separate different components of the signal, select the most relevant components which are used to quantify inter-limb deviation in singular value space. For this purpose, gait data are rearranged in two trajectory matrixes and a new symmetric feature revealing transient characteristic has been extracted. The proposed method has been evaluated and compared across three gait datasets recorded during different walking tasks. The experimental results have demonstrated that the use of new features outperforms most of the previous methods.

In this present cross-sectional study, we aimed to search for neural networks with electroencephalography whose frequency-specific actions may predict bradykinesia. Methods Twenty Parkinsonian patients treated with bilateral subthalamic stimulation were first prescreened while we selected four levels of contralateral stimulation (0: OFF, 1-3: decreasing symptoms to ON state) individually, based on kinematics. In the screening period, we performed 64-channel electroencephalography measurements simultaneously with electromyography and motion detection during a resting state, finger tapping, hand grasping tasks, and pronation-supination of the arm, with the four levels of contralateral stimulation. We analyzed spectral power at the low (13-20 Hz) and high (21-30 Hz) beta frequency bands and low (31-60 Hz) and high (61-100 Hz) gamma frequency bands using the dynamic imaging of coherent sources. Structural equation modelling estimated causal relationships between the slope of changes in network beta and gamma activities and the slope of changes in bradykinesia measures. Results Activity in different subnetworks, including predominantly the primary motor and premotor cortex, the subthalamic nucleus predicted the slopes in amplitude and speed while switching between stimulation levels. These subnetwork dynamics on their preferred frequencies predicted distinct types and parameters of the movement only on the contralateral side.

By using the event-related potential (ERP) technique, we sought to: (1) study the temporal dynamics of empathic responses in patients with PD; (2) explore whether dopaminergic medication modulates empathic processing. Methods Twenty-six patients with early-to-moderate PD (13 on- and 13 off-medication) and 14 healthy controls performed an empathy-for-pain paradigm test while we recorded their electroencephalography. The participants responded to neutral or painful pictures during an active empathic condition (pain judgment task) and a control condition that was manipulated by task demands (laterality judgment task). Results The ERP results demonstrated an early automatic frontal response and a late controlled parietal response to pain in healthy elderly controls. The observed early and late ERP responses were detected in the on-medication patients but not in the off-medication patients. Conclusions PD is associated with deficits in both affective and cognitive empathic responses, dopaminergic medication may have the potential to alleviate these deficits.

Methods We included 30 patients with PD and 15 healthy controls (HC). Six cognitive domains were estimated based on neuropsychological assessment. Phase-based connectivity at frontal and posterior cortical regions was estimated from a resting EEG. Results The PD group showed significant impairment for the executive, visuospatial, and language domains compared with HC. Increased connectivity at frontal regions was also found in the PD group. Frontal delta and theta connectivity negatively influenced general cognition and visuospatial performance, but this association was moderated by disease duration, with increased connectivity predicting worse performance after 8 years of disease duration.

EEG was recorded during the performance of a task, which evaluated the ability to utilize either implicit or explicit predictive contextual information in order to facilitate the detection of predictable versus random targets. Thus, subjects performed an implicit and explicit session, where subjects were either unaware or made aware of a predictive sequence that signals the presentation of a subsequent target, respectively. We evaluated EEG event-related directed connectivity, in PD patients compared with healthy age-matched controls, using phase transfer entropy. PD patients showed increased top-down frontal-parietal connectivity, compared to control subjects, during the processing of the last (most informative) stimulus of the predictive sequence and of random standards, in the implicit and explicit session, respectively. These findings suggest that PD is associated with compensatory top-down connectivity, specifically during the processing of implicit predictive stimuli. During the explicit session, PD patients seem to allocate more attentional resources to non-informative standard stimuli, compared to controls. These connectivity changes shed further light on the cognitive deficits, associated with the processing of predictive contextual information, that are observed in PD patients.",10<n<=20,Laboratory,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Nerve/Brain signals,BioPotential,,EEG,,j.bandc.2021.105773,Journal Article,
Neuronal biomarkers of Parkinson's disease are present in healthy aging,"Zhang J,Idaji MJ,Villringer A,Nikulin VV",2021,NeuroImage,"Resting state EEG, Healthy aging, Parkinson's disease, PAC, Beta burst","The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) increases with aging and both processes share similar cellular mechanisms and alterations in the dopaminergic system. Yet it remains to be investigated whether aging can also demonstrate electrophysiological neuronal signatures typically associated with PD. Previous work has shown that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the phase of beta oscillations and the amplitude of gamma oscillations as well as beta bursts features can serve as electrophysiological biomarkers for PD. Here we hypothesize that these metrics are also present in apparently healthy elderly subjects. Using resting state multichannel EEG measurements, we show that PAC between beta oscillation and broadband gamma activity (50-150 Hz) is elevated in a group of elderly (59-77 years) compared to young volunteers (20-35 years) without PD. Importantly, the increase of PAC is statistically significant even after ruling out confounds relating to changes in spectral power and non-sinusoidal shape of beta oscillation. Moreover, a trend for a higher percentage of longer beta bursts (> 0.2 s) along with the increase in their incidence rate is also observed for elderly subjects. Using inverse modeling, we further show that elevated PAC and longer beta bursts are most pronounced in the sensorimotor areas. Moreover, we show that PAC and longer beta bursts might reflect distinct mechanisms, since their spatial patterns only partially overlap and the correlation between them is weak. Taken together, our findings provide novel evidence that electrophysiological biomarkers of PD may already occur in apparently healthy elderly subjects. We hypothesize that PAC and beta bursts characteristics in aging might reflect a pre-clinical state of PD and suggest their predictive value to be tested in prospective longitudinal studies.",,Laboratory,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Nerve/Brain signals,BioPotential,,EEG,,j.neuroimage.2021.118512,Journal Article,

The neural mechanisms of speech deficits are not well understood. We examined a well-documented electrophysiological correlate of speech self-monitoring in patients with Parkinson's disease and control participants. Methods We measured evoked electroencephalographic responses to self-produced and passively heard sounds (/a/ phonemes) in age-matched controls (N = 18), and Parkinson's disease patients who had minor speech impairment, but reported subjectively experiencing no speech deficits (N = 17). Results During speaking, auditory evoked activity 100 ms after phonation (N1 wave) was less suppressed in Parkinson's disease than controls when compared to the activity evoked by passively heard phonemes. This difference between the groups was driven by increased amplitudes to self-produced phonemes, and reduced amplitudes passively heard phonemes in Parkinson's disease. Conclusions The finding indicates that auditory evoked activity is abnormally modulated during speech in Parkinson's patients who do not subjectively notice speech impairment. This mechanism could play a role in producing speech deficits in as the disease progresses.

However, the existing public Parkinson's disease(PD) speech datasets are characterized by small sample sizes, and the possible reason is that labeled speech data from PD patients are scarce. To solve the few-shot problem, a PD classification algorithm based on sparse kernel transfer learning combined with simultaneous sample and feature selection is proposed in this paper. Sparse kernel transfer learning is used to extract the effective structural information of PD speech features from public datasets as source domain data, and the fast alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) iteration is improved to enhance the information extraction performance. First, features are extracted from a public speech dataset to construct a feature dataset as the source domain. Then, the PD target domain, including the training and test datasets, is encoded by convolution sparse coding, which can extract more in-depth information. Next, simultaneous optimization is implemented. To further improve the classification performance, a convolution kernel optimization mechanism is designed. In the experimental section, two representative PD speech datasets are used for verification; the first dataset is a frequently used public dataset, and the second dataset is constructed by the authors. Over ten relevant algorithms are compared with the proposed method. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves obvious improvements in terms of classification accuracy. The study also found that the improvements are considerable when compared with nontransfer learning approaches, demonstrating that the proposed transfer learning approach is more effective and has an acceptable time cost.",,Existing Dataset,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,j.bspc.2021.102850,Journal Article,

Clinicians commonly assess bradykinesia by making a visual judgement of the patient tapping finger and thumb together repetitively. However, inter-rater agreement of expert assessments has been shown to be only moderate, at best. Aim We propose a low-cost, contactless system using smartphone videos to automatically determine the presence of bradykinesia. Methods We collected 70 videos of finger-tap assessments in a clinical setting (40 Parkinson's hands, 30 control hands). Two clinical experts in Parkinson's, blinded to the diagnosis, evaluated the videos to give a grade of bradykinesia severity between 0 and 4 using the Unified Pakinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). We developed a computer vision approach that identifies regions related to hand motion and extracts clinically-relevant features. Dimensionality reduction was undertaken using principal component analysis before input to classification models (NaÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine) to predict no/slight bradykinesia (UPDRS = 0-1) or mild/moderate/severe bradykinesia (UPDRS = 2-4), and presence or absence of Parkinson's diagnosis.

The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) has been suggested as a promising tool to identify and quantify neurophysiological mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate specific changes in electrical brain activity in response to stimulation of four brain areas in patients with PD. Methods 21 healthy controls and 32 patients with PD underwent a combined TMS-EEG assessment that included stimulation of four brain areas: left M1, right M1, left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and right DLPFC. Six measures were calculated to characterize the TMS evoked potentials (TEP) using EEG: (1) wave form adherence (WFA), (2) late phase deflection (LPD), (3) early phase deflection (EPD), (4) short-term plasticity (STP), (5) inter-trial adherence, and (6) connectivity between right and left M1 and DLPFC. A Linear mixed-model was used to compare these measures between groups and areas stimulated. Results Patients with PD showed lower WFA (p = 0.052), lower EPD (p = 0.009), lower inter-trial adherence (p < 0.001), and lower connectivity between homologs areas (p = 0.050), compared to healthy controls. LPD and STP measures were not different between the groups. In addition, lower inter-trial adherence correlated with longer disease duration (r = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™0.355, p = 0.050).

A positive correlation was found between the freezing of the gait questionnaire (FOGQ) and delta spectral power band (rho=0.67; p=0.008), while a negative correlation with the same scale was observed in the alpha spectral power band (rho=-0.59, p=0.027).

The aim of this work is to assess which measures from the instrumented Timed Up and Go test (recorded with inertial sensors) are valid balance measures in Parkinson's disease and evaluate their responsiveness to rehabilitation. Methods The Mini-BESTest (a criterion-standard balance measure) and the instrumented Timed Up and Go test (with inertial sensors secured to the trunk) were administered to 20 Parkinson's disease patients before and after inpatient rehabilitation (median [IQR]; 76.5 [8.25] years; 5 females; Hoehn and Yahr stage: 2.5 [0.5]). 81 parameters from the instrumented Timed Up and Go test were evaluated.

Seeing the unseen: Could Eulerian video magnification aid clinician detection of subclinical Parkinson's tremor?,"Williams S,Fang H,Relton SD,Graham CD,Alty JE",2020,Journal of Clinical Neuroscience,"Parkinsonism, Tremor, Clinical features, Computer vision, Artificial intelligence, Eulerian magnification","Introduction Eulerian magnification amplifies very small movements in video, revealing otherwise invisible motion. This raises the possibility that it could enable clinician visualisation of subclinical tremor using a standard camera. We tested whether Eulerian magnification of apparently atremulous hands reveals a Parkinsonian tremor more frequently in Parkinson's than in controls. Method We applied Eulerian magnification to smartphone video of 48 hands that appeared atremulous during recording (22 hands from 11 control participants, 26 hands from 17 idiopathic Parkinson's participants). Videos were rated for Parkinsonian tremor appearance (yes/no) before and after Eulerian magnification by three Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia specialist neurologists. Results The proportion of hands correctly classified as Parkinsonian or not by clinicians was significantly higher after Eulerian magnification (OR = 2.67; CI = [1.39, 5.17]; p < 0.003). Parkinsonian-appearance tremors were seen after magnification in a number of control hands, but the proportion was greater in the Parkinson's hands. Conclusion Eulerian magnification slightly improves clinician ability to identify apparently atremulous hands as Parkinsonian. This suggests that some of the apparent tremor revealed may be subclinical Parkinson's (pathological) tremor, and Eulerian magnification may represent a first step towards contactless visualisation of such tremor. However, the technique also reveals apparent tremor in control hands. Therefore, our method needs additional elaboration and would not be of direct clinical use in its current iteration.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor,Video Recording,,Video recording,,j.jocn.2020.09.046,Journal Article,
Prediction of motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores in patients with Parkinson's disease using surface electromyography,"Kleinholdermann U,Wullstein M,Pedrosa D",2021,Clinical Neurophysiology,"Parkinson's disease, Electromyography, Machine learning, Regression, UPDRS, Wearables","Objective Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with increasing prevalence in the elderly. Especially patients with advanced PD often require complex medication regimens due to fluctuations, that is abrupt transitions from ON to OFF or vice versa. Current gold standard to quantify PD-patients' motor symptoms is the assessment of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which, however, is cumbersome and may depend upon investigators. This work aimed at developing a mobile, objective and unobtrusive measurement of motor symptoms in PD. Methods Data from 45 PD-patients was recorded using surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes attached to a wristband. The motor paradigm consisted of a tapping task performed with and without dopaminergic medication. Our aim was to predict UPDRS scores from the sEMG characteristics with distinct regression models and machine learning techniques. Results A random forest regression model outnumbered other regression models resulting in a correlation of 0.739 between true and predicted UPDRS values. Conclusions PD-patients' motor affection can be extrapolated from sEMG data during a simple tapping task. In the future, such records could help determine the need for medication changes in telemedicine applications. Significance Our findings support the utility of wearables to detect Parkinson's symptoms and could help in developing tailored therapies in the future.",>30,Laboratory,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Muscle Activity,Wearable,,EMG,,j.clinph.2021.01.031,Journal Article,
Neural correlates of speech and limb motor timing deficits revealed by aberrant beta band desynchronization in Parkinson's disease,"Johari K,Behroozmand R",2021,Clinical Neurophysiology,"Parkinson's disease, Beta band oscillations, Neural desynchronization, Speech production, Limb movement, Reaction time","Objective We used a classical motor reaction time paradigm to examine the effects of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the mechanisms of speech production and upper limb movement. Methods Electro-encephalography (EEG) signals were recorded in PD and control groups during speech vowel production and button press tasks in response to temporally predictable and unpredictable visual stimuli. Results Motor reaction times were slower in PD vs. control group independent of stimulus timing and movement modality. This effect was accompanied by stronger desynchronizations of low beta (13-18 Hz) and high beta (18-25 Hz) band neural oscillations in PD vs. control prior to the onset of speech and hand movement. In addition, pre-movement desynchronization of beta band oscillations were correlated with motor reaction time in control subjects with faster responses associated with weaker beta band desynchronizations during the planning phase of movement. However, no such effect was found in the PD group. Conclusions We suggest that the aberrant pattern of beta band desynchronization is a neural correlate of speech and upper limb motor timing deficits as a result of cortico-striatal pathology in PD. Significance These findings motivate interventions targeted toward normalizing beta band activities for improving speech and upper limb movement timing in PD.",10<n<=20,Existing Dataset,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech topics,BioPotential,,EEG,,j.clinph.2021.06.022,Journal Article,
Deep 1D-Convnet for accurate Parkinson disease detection and severity prediction from gait,"El Maachi I,Bilodeau GA,Bouachir W",2020,Expert Systems with Applications,"1D-Convnet, Parkinson, Gait, Classification, Deep learning","Diagnosing Parkinson's disease is a complex task that requires the evaluation of several motor and non-motor symptoms. During diagnosis, gait abnormalities are among the important symptoms that physicians should consider. However, gait evaluation is challenging and relies on the expertise and subjectivity of clinicians. In this context, the use of an intelligent gait analysis algorithm may assist physicians in order to facilitate the diagnosis process. This paper proposes a novel intelligent Parkinson detection system based on deep learning techniques to analyze gait information. We used 1D convolutional neural network (1D-Convnet) to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier. The proposed model processes 18 1D-signals coming from foot sensors measuring the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF). The first part of the network consists of 18 parallel 1D-Convnet corresponding to system inputs. The second part is a fully connected network that connects the concatenated outputs of the 1D-Convnets to obtain a final classification. We tested our algorithm in Parkinson's detection and in the prediction of the severity of the disease with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Our experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method in the detection of Parkinson disease based on gait data. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 98.7%. To our knowledge, this is the state-of-the-start performance in Parkinson's gait recognition. Furthermore, we achieved an accuracy of 85.3% in Parkinson's severity prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to perform a severity prediction based on the UPDRS. These results show that the model is able to learn intrinsic characteristics from gait data and to generalize to unseen subjects, which could be helpful in a clinical diagnosis.",>30,Existing Dataset,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Force/Pressure,,Force sensor,,j.eswa.2019.113075,Journal Article,
Speech Based Estimation of Parkinson's Disease Using Gaussian Processes and Automatic Relevance Determination,"Despotovic V,Skovranek T,Schommer C",2020,Neurocomputing,"Speech disorder, Parkinson's disease, Machine learning, Gaussian processes, Feature selection","Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder often accompanied by impairment in articulation, phonation, prosody and fluency of speech. In fact, speech impairment is one of the earliest Parkinson's disease symptoms, and may be used for early diagnosis. We present an experimental study of identification of Parkinson's disease and assessment of disease progress from speech using Gaussian processes, which is further combined with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) for efficient feature selection. Hyperparameters of ARD covariance functions are learned for each individual feature; therefore, can be used for evaluation of their importance. In that way only a small subset of highly relevant acoustic features is selected, leading to models with better performance and lower complexity. The performance of the proposed method was assessed on two datasets: Parkinson's disease detection dataset, which contains a range of biomedical voice measurements obtained from 31 subjects, 23 of them suffering from Parkinson's disease and 8 healthy subjects; and Parkinson's telemonitoring dataset, containing biomedical voice measurements collected from 42 Parkinson's disease patients for estimation of the disease progress. Gaussian process classification with automatic relevance determination is able to successfully discriminate between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls with 96.92% accuracy, outperforming Support Vector Machines and decision tree ensembles (random forests, boosted and bagged decision trees). The usability of Gaussian processes is further confirmed in regression task for tracking the progress of the disease.",20<n<=30,Laboratory,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,j.neucom.2020.03.058,Journal Article,

Dementia in PD worsens the quality of life and poses a burden on caregivers. Objective markers of the presence and as well as onset of dementia needs to be explored to improve the quality of life. We attempted to identify EEG abnormalities that differentiate PD patients with or without dementia using high density EEG. The differential changes in the EEG spectral activity could mark the early stage as well as onset of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods The present study was designed to find out the resting eyes-closed (EC) EEG characteristics in PD with dementia (PDD) and without dementia (PDND) compared to healthy controls (CON) of both gender using high density EEG. Absolute power of seven frequency bands based on individual alpha frequency was estimated by Fast Fourier transform algorithm in 58 PD patients (30 PDND and 28 PDD) and 26 CON. Results Compared to CON, PDND had higher power in theta and lower alpha1 bands while PDD had higher power in delta, theta, lower alpha1 and beta bands. Higher delta and gamma power with no difference in theta and lower alpha 1 power was the characteristic feature of PD patients with dementia compared to non-dementia. Conclusions This cross-sectional study proposes to use these differential changes in power as EEG signatures of appearance of dementia in PD.

Recognizing Parkinson's disease gait patterns by vibes algorithm and Hilbert-Huang transform,"AydÃƒÂ„Ã‚Â±n F,Aslan Z",2021,"Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal","Machine Learning, Parkinson's Disease, Ensemble Learning, Hilbert-Huang Transform, Feature Engineering","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder all over the world. There are resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rarely dystonia, all of which are motor symptoms, among the manifestations of PD. But the direct use of these motor symptoms for diagnosis can be misleading since PD can be confused with other Parkinsonisms and further disorders with a similar symptom. Therefore gait can be used, which has significant dynamics in the detection of PD and is an extremely complex motion. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art ensemble learning algorithm, called the vibes algorithm, and the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) to recognize PD gait patterns. We extracted the features by the processing of the signals, which come from sixteen sensors on the bottom of both feet, through HHT and sixteen statistical functions. We then performed the two-stage feature selection process by using the vibes algorithm and the OneRAttributeEval algorithm. Finally, we exploited the vibes algorithm and the Classification and Regression Trees as a base learner to differentiate between patients with PD and the control group. The classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity rates of the proposed method are 98.79%, 98.92%, and 98.61%, respectively. Moreover, we thoroughly contrasted our method with the previous sixteen works. The experiment results demonstrated that our method is high-performance and maintains stability.

Local discriminant preservation projection embedded ensemble learning based dimensionality reduction of speech data of Parkinson's disease,"Liu Y,Li Y,Tan X,Wang P,Zhang Y",2021,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,"Parkinson's disease, Data processing, Dimensionality reduction, Preservation projection, Embedded ensemble","Speech has been widely used in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the collected PD speech data has the characteristics of high data redundancy, high aliasing and small sample size, which brings great challenges to PD speech recognition. Dimensionality reduction (DR) can effectively solve these problems. However, the existing methods for PD speech DR methods ignore the high noise and high aliasing characteristics of PD speech. In order to alleviate these problems, a weighted local discriminant preservation projection embedded ensemble algorithm is proposed to detect PD. The proposed algorithm preferentially reduces the intra-class variance of PD speech samples, and simultaneously increases the inter-class variance and maintains the neighborhood structure of PD speech samples. In addition, the idea of ensemble learning is introduced to increase the stability of the model. Two widely used PD speech datasets for diagnosis and a treated Parkinson patient speech dataset collected by ourselves were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with existing PD speech DR methods, the proposed algorithm always has the highest Accuracy, Precision, Recall and G-mean in PD speech datasets. This shows that the proposed algorithm not only has excellent performance in classification of PD speech data, but also can handle imbalanced PD samples well. Even compared with the state-of-the-art DR methods, the proposed method was improved by at least 4.34 %. In addition, the proposed algorithm not only achieved the highest detection accuracy, but also achieved the highest AUC in most case.",>30,Existing Dataset,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,j.bspc.2020.102165,Journal Article,

We evaluated quantitative mobility measures from a wearable device compared to the conventional motor assessment, the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias Society-Unified PD Rating Scale part III (motor MDS-UPDRS). Methods We evaluated 176 PD subjects (mean age 65, 65% male, 66% H&Y stage 2) during routine clinic visits using the motor MDS-UPDRS and a 10-min motor protocol with a body-fixed sensor (DynaPort MT, McRoberts BV), including the 32-ft walk, Timed Up and Go (TUG), and standing posture with eyes closed. Regression models examined 12 quantitative mobility measures for associations with (i) motor MDS-UPDRS, (ii) motor subtype (tremor dominant vs. postural instability/gait difficulty), (iii) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and (iv) physical functioning disability (PROMIS-29). All analyses included age, gender, and disease duration as covariates. Models iii-iv were secondarily adjusted for motor MDS-UPDRS. Results Quantitative mobility measures from gait, TUG transitions, turning, and posture were significantly associated with motor MDS-UPDRS (7 of 12 measures, p < 0.05) and motor subtype (6 of 12 measures, p < 0.05). Compared with motor MDS-UPDRS, several quantitative mobility measures accounted for a 1.5- or 1.9-fold increased variance in either cognition or physical functioning disability, respectively. Among minimally-impaired subjects in the bottom quartile of motor MDS-UPDRS, including subjects with normal gait exam, the measures captured substantial residual motor heterogeneity.

There is urgent need for new tools to objectively measure the condition. Existing methods to record the cardinal motor feature of the condition, bradykinesia, using wearable sensors or smartphone apps have not reached large-scale, routine use. We evaluate new computer vision (artificial intelligence) technology, DeepLabCut, as a contactless method to quantify measures related to Parkinson's bradykinesia from smartphone videos of finger tapping. Methods Standard smartphone video recordings of 133 hands performing finger tapping (39 idiopathic Parkinson's patients and 30 controls) were tracked on a frame-by-frame basis with DeepLabCut. Objective computer measures of tapping speed, amplitude and rhythm were correlated with clinical ratings made by 22 Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia neurologists using the Modified Bradykinesia Rating Scale (MBRS) and Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Results DeepLabCut reliably tracked and measured finger tapping in standard smartphone video. Computer measures correlated well with clinical ratings of bradykinesia (Spearman coefficients): ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™0.74 speed, 0.66 amplitude, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™0.65 rhythm for MBRS; ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™0.56 speed, 0.61 amplitude, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™0.50 rhythm for MDS-UPDRS; ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™0.69 combined for MDS-UPDRS.

Clinical assessment is a complex and time-consuming task, especially for bradykinesia, since its evaluation can be influenced by the degree of experience of the examiner, patient collaboration and individual bias. Improvement of the clinical evaluation can be obtained by considering assessments from several professionals. However, this is only true when inter and intra-rater agreement are high. Recently, the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society highlighted, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to develop and validate technologies for remote assessment of the motor status of people with PD. Thus, this study introduces an objective strategy for the remote evaluation of bradykinesia using multi-specialist analysis. Methods Twelve volunteers with PD participated and these were asked to execute finger tapping, hand opening/closing and pronation/supination movements. Each task was recorded and rated by fourteen PD health experts for each patient. The scores were assessed on an individual basis. Intra and inter-rater agreement and correlation were estimated. Results The results showed that agreements and correlations between experienced examiners were high with low variability. In addition, group analysis was noted as possessing the potential to solve individual inconsistency bias. Conclusion Furthermore, this study demonstrated the need for a group with prior training and experience, along with indicating the importance for the development of a clinical protocol that can use telemedicine for the evaluation of individuals with PD, as well as the inclusion of a specialized mediating group.

Dissecting beta-state changes during timed movement preparation in Parkinson's disease,"Heideman SG,Quinn AJ,Woolrich MW,van Ede F,Nobre AC",2020,Progress in Neurobiology,"Beta oscillations, Burst-events, Parkinson's disease, Movement, Timing","An emerging perspective describes beta-band (15ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™28 Hz) activity as consisting of short-lived high-amplitude events that only appear sustained in conventional measures of trial-average power. This has important implications for characterising abnormalities observed in beta-band activity in disorders like Parkinson's disease. Measuring parameters associated with beta-event dynamics may yield more sensitive measures, provide more selective diagnostic neural markers, and provide greater mechanistic insight into the breakdown of brain dynamics in this disease. Here, we used magnetoencephalography in eighteen Parkinson's disease participants off dopaminergic medication and eighteen healthy control participants to investigate beta-event dynamics during timed movement preparation. We used the Hidden Markov Model to classify event dynamics in a data-driven manner and derived three parameters of beta events: (1) beta-state amplitude, (2) beta-state lifetime, and (3) beta-state interval time. Of these, changes in beta-state interval time explained the overall decreases in beta power during timed movement preparation and uniquely captured the impairment in such preparation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Thus, the increased granularity of the Hidden Markov Model analysis (compared with conventional analysis of power) provides increased sensitivity and suggests a possible reason for impairments of timed movement preparation in Parkinson's disease.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Brain signals,BioPotential,,magnetoencephalography,,j.pneurobio.2019.101731,Journal Article,

Previous research studying objective measures of speech symptoms involved patients and examiners who were native language speakers. Measures such as cepstral separation difference (CSD) features to quantify dysphonia and dysprosody accurately distinguish the severity of speech impairment. Importantly CSD, together with other speech features, including Mel-frequency coefficients, fundamental-frequency variation, and spectral dynamics, characterize speech intelligibility in PD. However, non-native language speakers transfer phonological rules of their mother language that tamper speech assessment. Objectives This paper explores CSD's capability: first, to quantify dysprosody and dysphonia of non-native language speakers, Parkinson patients and controls, and secondly, to characterize the severity of speech impairment when Parkinson's dysprosody accompanies non-native linguistic dysprosody. Methods CSD features were extracted from 168 speech samples recorded from 19 healthy controls, 15 rehabilitated and 23 not-rehabilitated Parkinson patients in three different clinical speech tests based on Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale motor-speech examination. Statistical analyses were performed to compare groups using analysis of variance, intraclass correlation, and Guttman correlation coefficient ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Âµ2. Random forests were trained to classify the severity of speech impairment using CSD and the other speech features. Feature importance in classification was determined using permutation importance score. Results Results showed that the CSD feature describing dysphonia was uninfluenced by non-native accents, strongly correlated with the clinical examination (ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Âµ2>0.5), and significantly discriminated between the healthy, rehabilitated, and not-rehabilitated patient groups based on the severity of speech symptoms. However, the feature describing dysprosody did not correlate with the clinical examination but significantly distinguished the groups. The classification model based on random forests and selected features characterized the severity of speech impairment of non-native language speakers with high accuracy. Importantly, the permutation importance score of the CSD feature representing dysphonia was the highest compared to other features. Results showed a strong negative correlation (ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Âµ2<-0.5) between L-dopa administration and the CSD features. Conclusions Although non-native accents reduce speech intelligibility, the CSD features can accurately characterize speech impairment, which is not always possible in the clinical examination.

Research question Are functional limits of stability (fLoS) or postural sway during stance measured with wearable inertial sensors different between PD + FoG versus PD-FoG, as well as between PD versus healthy control subjects (HC)? Methods Sixty-four PD subjects with FoG (MDS-UPDRS Part III: 45.9 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 12.5) and 80 PD subjects without FoG (MDS-UPDRS Part III: 36.2 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 10.9) were tested Off medication and compared with 79 HC. Balance was quantified with inertial sensors worn on the lumbar spine while performing the following balance tasks: 1) fLoS as defined by the maximum displacement in the forward and backward directions and 2) postural sway area while standing with eyes open on a firm and foam surface. An ANOVA, controlling for disease duration, compared postural control between groups. Results PD + FoG had significantly smaller fLoS compared to PD-FoG (p = 0.004) and to healthy controls (p < 0.001). However, PD-FoG showed similar fLoS compared to healthy controls (p = 0.48).

However, the turning characteristics have not yet been extensively investigated to distinguish between people with PD with and without FOG (freezers and non-freezers) based on full-body kinematic analysis during the turning task. The objectives of this study were to identify the machine learning model that best classifies people with PD and freezers and reveal the associations between clinical characteristics and turning features based on feature selection through stepwise regression. The study recruited 77 people with PD (31 freezers and 46 non-freezers) and 34 age-matched older adults. The 360Â° turning task was performed at the preferred speed for the inner step of the more affected limb. All experiments on the people with PD were performed in the â€œOffâ€ state of medication. The full-body kinematic features during the turning task were extracted using the three-dimensional motion capture system. These features were selected via stepwise regression. In feature selection through stepwise regression, five and six features were identified to distinguish between people with PD and controls and between freezers and non-freezers (PD and FOG classification problem), respectively. The machine learning model accuracies revealed that the random forest (RF) model had 98.1% accuracy when using all turning features and 98.0% accuracy when using the five features selected for PD classification. In addition, RF and logistic regression showed accuracies of 79.4% when using all turning features and 72.9% when using the six selected features for FOG classification. We suggest that our study leads to understanding of the turning characteristics of people with PD and freezers during the 360Â° turning task for the inner step of the more affected limb and may help improve the objective classification and clinical assessment by disease progression using turning features.

Freezing of Gait (FoG) is one of the severe symptoms that is observed in the late stages of the disease and considerably impairs the mobility of the person and raises the risk of falls. Due to the pathology and heterogeneity of the Parkinsonian gait cycle, especially in the case of freezing episodes, the detection of the gait phases with wearables is challenging in Parkinson's disease. This is addressed by introducing a state-automaton-based algorithm for the detection of the foot's motion phases using a shoe-placed inertial sensor. Machine-learning-based methods are investigated to classify the actual motion phase as normal or FoG-affected and to predict the outcome for the next motion phase. For this purpose, spatio-temporal gait and signal parameters are determined from the segmented movement phases. In this context, inertial sensor fusion is applied to the foot's 3D acceleration and rate of turn. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and AdaBoost classifiers have been trained on the data of 16 Parkinson's patients who had shown FoG episodes during a clinical freezing-provoking assessment course. Two clinical experts rated the video-recorded trials and marked episodes with festination, shank trembling, shuffling, or akinesia. Motion phases inside such episodes were labeled as FoG-affected. The classifiers were evaluated using leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. No statistically significant differences could be observed between the different classifiers for FoG detection ( p >0.05). An SVM model with 10 features of the actual and two preceding motion phases achieved the highest average performance with 88.5 Â± 5.8% sensitivity, 83.3 Â± 17.1% specificity, and 92.8 Â± 5.9% Area Under the Curve (AUC). The performance of predicting the behavior of the next motion phase was significantly lower compared to the detection classifiers. No statistically significant differences were found between all prediction models. An SVM-predictor with features from the two preceding motion phases had with 81.6 Â± 7.7% sensitivity, 70.3 Â± 18.4% specificity, and 82.8 Â± 7.1% AUC the best average performance. The developed methods enable motion-phase-based FoG detection and prediction and can be utilized for closed-loop systems that provide on-demand gait-phase-synchronous cueing to mitigate FoG symptoms and to prevent complete motoric blockades.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,FoG,Wearable,,IMU,,fneur.2021.720516,research-article,

Ray; Sharma, Gaurav",2021,NPJ Parkinson's Disease,"Neurological manifestations,Parkinson's disease","Most wearable sensor studies in Parkinsonâ€™s disease have been conducted in the clinic and thus may not be a true representation of everyday symptoms and symptom variation. Our goal was to measure activity, gait, and tremor using wearable sensors inside and outside the clinic. In this observational study, we assessed motor features using wearable sensors developed by MC10, Inc. Participants wore five sensors, one on each limb and on the trunk, during an in-person clinic visit and for two days thereafter. Using the accelerometer data from the sensors, activity states (lying, sitting, standing, walking) were determined and steps per day were also computed by aggregating over 2â€‰s walking intervals. For non-walking periods, tremor durations were identified that had a characteristic frequency between 3 and 10â€‰Hz. We analyzed data from 17 individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease and 17 age-matched controls over an average 45.4â€‰h of sensor wear. Individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s walked significantly less (median [inter-quartile range]: 4980 [2835â€“7163] steps/day) than controls (7367 [5106â€“8928] steps/day; P â€‰=â€‰0.04). Tremor was present for 1.6 [0.4â€“5.9] hours (median [range]) per day in most-affected hands (MDS-UPDRS 3.17a or 3.17bâ€‰=â€‰1â€“4) of individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s, which was significantly higher than the 0.5 [0.3â€“2.3] hours per day in less-affected hands (MDS-UPDRS 3.17a or 3.17bâ€‰=â€‰0). These results, which require replication in larger cohorts, advance our understanding of the manifestations of Parkinsonâ€™s in real-world settings.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Motion,Activities of Daily Living,Tremor",Wearable,,IMU,,s41531-021-00248-w,research-article,

Confirming the technical validity of inertial sensors with a 3D motion capture system is a necessary step for the clinical application of sensor-based gait analysis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare gait parameters measured by a mobile sensor-based gait analysis system and a motion capture system as the gold standard. Gait parameters of 37 patients were compared between both systems after performing a standardized 5 Ã— 10 m walking test by reliability analysis using intra-class correlation and Blandâ€“Altman plots. Additionally, gait parameters of an age-matched healthy control group ( n = 14) were compared to the Parkinson cohort. Gait parameters representing bradykinesia and short steps showed excellent reliability (ICC > 0.96). Shuffling gait parameters reached ICC > 0.82. In a stridewise synchronization, no differences were observed for gait speed, stride length, stride time, relative stance and swing time ( p > 0.05). In contrast, heel strike, toe off and toe clearance significantly differed between both systems ( p < 0.01). Both gait analysis systems distinguish Parkinson patients from controls. Our results indicate that wearable sensors generate valid gait parameters compared to the motion capture system and can consequently be used for clinically relevant gait recordings in flexible environments.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Wearable,Motion tracker,IMU,,s21227680,research-article,

Exploring Test-Retest Reliability and Longitudinal Stability of Digital Biomarkers for Parkinson Disease in the m-Power Data Set: Cohort Study,,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"health sciences,medical research,biomarkers,diagnostic markers,neurological disorders,Parkinson disease,mobile phone","Digital biomarkers (DB), as captured using sensors embedded in modern smart devices, are a promising technology for home-based sign and symptom monitoring in Parkinson disease (PD). Despite extensive application in recent studies, test-retest reliability and longitudinal stability of DB have not been well addressed in this context. We utilized the large-scale m-Power data set to establish the test-retest reliability and longitudinal stability of gait, balance, voice, and tapping tasks in an unsupervised and self-administered daily life setting in patients with PD and healthy controls (HC). Intraclass correlation coefficients were computed to estimate the test-retest reliability of features that also differentiate between patients with PD and healthy volunteers. In addition, we tested for longitudinal stability of DB measures in PD and HC, as well as for their sensitivity to PD medication effects. Among the features differing between PD and HC, only a few tapping and voice features had good to excellent test-retest reliabilities and medium to large effect sizes. All other features performed poorly in this respect. Only a few features were sensitive to medication effects. The longitudinal analyses revealed significant alterations over time across a variety of features and in particular for the tapping task. These results indicate the need for further development of more standardized, sensitive, and reliable DB for application in self-administered remote studies in patients with PD. Motivational, learning, and other confounders may cause variations in performance that need to be considered in DB longitudinal applications.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech topics,BioPotential,,,,26608,research-article,
Data-Driven Prediction of Fatigue in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Patients,"Lee, Dong Goo; Lindsay, Adrian; Yu, Adam; Neilson, Samantha; Sundvick, Kristen; Golz, Ella; Foulger, Liam; Mirian, Maryam; Appel-Cresswell, Silke",2021,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,"Parkinsonâ€™s disease,fatigue,machine learning,artificial intelligence,sex,random forest,Boruta,principal components analysis","Introduction: Numerous non-motor symptoms are associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) including fatigue. The challenge in the clinic is to detect relevant non-motor symptoms while keeping patient-burden of questionnaires low and to take potential subgroups such as sex differences into account. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) effectively detects clinically significant fatigue in PD patients. Machine learning techniques can determine which FSS items best predict clinically significant fatigue yet the choice of technique is crucial as it determines the stability of results. Methods: 182 records of PD patients were analyzed with two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and Boruta. RF and Boruta calculated feature importance scores, which measured how much impact an FSS item had in predicting clinically significant fatigue. Items with the highest feature importance scores were the best predictors. Principal components analysis (PCA) grouped highly related FSS items together. Results: RF, Boruta and PCA demonstrated that items 8 (â€œFatigue is among my three most disabling symptomsâ€) and 9 (â€œFatigue interferes with my work, family or social lifeâ€) were the most important predictors. Item 5 (â€œFatigue causes frequent problems for meâ€) was an important predictor for females, and item 6 (â€œMy fatigue prevents sustained physical functioningâ€) was important for males. Feature importance scoresâ€™ standard deviations were large for RF (14â€“66%) but small for Boruta (0â€“5%). Conclusion: The clinically most informative questions may be how disabling fatigue is compared to other symptoms and interference with work, family and friends. There may be some sex-related differences with frequency of fatigue-related complaints in females and endurance-related complaints in males yielding significant information. Boruta but not RF yielded stable results and might be a better tool to determine the most relevant components of abbreviated questionnaires. Further research in this area would be beneficial in order to replicate these findings with other machine learning algorithms, and using a more representative sample of PD patients.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,,Other,,,,frai.2021.678678,research-article,

During walking, SE manifests as a step-by-step reduction in step length when approaching a turning point or gait destination, resulting in the so-called destination sequence effect (dSE). Previous studies explored the therapeutic effects of several strategies on SE, but none of them evaluated the role of an intensive rehabilitative program. Objectives: Here we aim to study the effects of a 4-week rehabilitative program on dSE in patients with PD with and without FOG. Methods: Forty-three patients (30 males, 70.6 Â± 7.5 years old) with idiopathic PD were enrolled. The subjects were divided into two groups: patients with (PD + FOG, n = 23) and without FOG (PD â€“ FOG, n = 20). All patients underwent a standardized 4-week intensive rehabilitation in-hospital program. At hospital admission (T0) and discharge (T1), all subjects were evaluated with an inertial gait analysis for dSE recording. Results: At T0, the dSE was more negative in the PD + FOG group (âˆ’0.80 Â± 0.6) when compared to the PD â€“ FOG group (âˆ’0.39 Â± 0.3) ( p = 0.007), even when controlling for several clinical and demographic features. At T1, the dSE was reduced in the overall study population ( p = 0.001), with a more pronounced improvement in the PD + FOG group (T0: âˆ’0.80 Â± 0.6; T1: âˆ’0.23 Â± 0.4) when compared to the PD â€“ FOG group (T0: âˆ’0.39 Â± 0.3; T1: âˆ’0.22 Â± 0.5) ( p = 0.012). At T1, we described in the overall study population an improvement in speed, cadence, stride duration, and stride length ( p = 0.001 for all variables). Conclusions: dSE is a core feature of PD gait dysfunction, specifically in patients with FOG. A 4-week intensive rehabilitative program improved dSE in PD patients, exerting a more notable beneficial effect in the PD + FOG group.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,,,fneur.2021.723468,research-article,
"Exercise Management Using a Mobile App in Patients With Parkinsonism: Prospective, Open-Label, Single-Arm Pilot Study",,2021,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"Parkinsonian disorders,exercise,mobile apps,mhealth,Parkinson","Patients with parkinsonism have higher inactivity levels than the general population, and this results in increased comorbidities. Although exercise has benefits for motor function and quality of life (QOL) in patients with parkinsonism, these patients face many barriers to exercise participation, such as lack of motivation, fatigue, depression, and time constraints. Recently, the use of mobile apps has been highlighted as a remote exercise management strategy for patients with chronic diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of home-based exercise management with a customized mobile app on the exercise amount, physical activity, and QOL of patients with parkinsonism. This was a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study. The therapist installed the app in the smartphones of the participants and educated them on how to use the app. The therapist developed an individualized multimodal exercise program that consisted of stretching, strengthening, aerobic, balance and coordination, and oral-motor and vocal exercises. Participants were encouraged to engage in an 8-week home-based exercise program delivered through a customized app. The alarm notifications of the app provided reminders to exercise regularly at home. The primary outcome was the exercise amount. The secondary outcomes were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The usability of the customized app was assessed using a self-report questionnaire. A total of 21 participants with parkinsonism completed the intervention and assessment between September and December 2020 (mean age: 72 years; women: 17/21, 81%; men: 4/21, 19%). The participants reported a significant increase in the total amount of exercise (baseline: mean 343.33, SD 206.70 min/week; 8-week follow-up: mean 693.10, SD 373.45 min/week; P <.001) and in the amount of each exercise component, including stretching, strengthening, balance and coordination, and oral-motor and vocal exercise after 8 weeks. Analysis of the secondary outcomes revealed significant improvements in the IPAQ ( P =.006), PDQ-39 ( P =.02), and GDS ( P =.04) scores. The usability of the program with the mobile app was verified based on the positive responses such as â€œintention to useâ€ and â€œrole expectation for rehabilitation.â€ Exercise management with a customized mobile app may be beneficial for improving exercise adherence, physical activity levels, depression management, and QOL in patients with parkinsonism. This remotely supervised technology-based, reinforcing, and multimodal exercise management strategy is recommended for use in patients with parkinsonism. In addition, this program proved useful as an alternative exercise management strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic when patients with Parkinson disease were less physically active than before and showed aggravation of symptoms. However, additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this exercise program in a large population and to confirm its disease-modifying effects.",20<n<=30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Physical Activities,Smartphone,,,,27662,research-article,

Treatment changes in PD are frequently driven by gait assessments in the clinic, commonly rated as part of the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society (MDS) Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessment (item 3.10). We proposed and evaluated a novel approach for estimating severity of gait impairment in Parkinsonâ€™s disease using a computer vision-based methodology. The system we developed can be used to obtain an estimate for a rating to catch potential errors, or to gain an initial rating in the absence of a trained clinicianâ€”for example, during remote home assessments. Videos ( ) were collected as part of routine MDS-UPDRS gait assessments of Parkinsonâ€™s patients, and a deep learning library was used to extract body key-point coordinates for each frame. Data were recorded at five clinical sites using commercially available mobile phones or tablets, and had an associated severity rating from a trained clinician. Six features were calculated from time-series signals of the extracted key-points. These features characterized key aspects of the movement including speed (step frequency, estimated using a novel Gamma-Poisson Bayesian model), arm swing, postural control and smoothness (or roughness) of movement. An ordinal random forest classification model (with one class for each of the possible ratings) was trained and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. Step frequency point estimates from the Bayesian model were highly correlated with manually labelled step frequencies of 606 video clips showing patients walking towards or away from the camera (Pearsonâ€™s , ). Our classifier achieved a balanced accuracy of 50% (chance = 25%). Estimated UPDRS ratings were within one of the cliniciansâ€™ ratings in 95% of cases. There was a significant correlation between clinician labels and model estimates (Spearmanâ€™s , ). We show how the interpretability of the feature values could be used by clinicians to support their decision-making and provide insight into the modelâ€™s objective UPDRS rating estimation. The severity of gait impairment in Parkinsonâ€™s disease can be estimated using a single patient video, recorded using a consumer mobile device and within standard clinical settings; i.e., videos were recorded in various hospital hallways and offices rather than gait laboratories. This approach can support clinicians during routine assessments by providing an objective rating (or second opinion), and has the potential to be used for remote home assessments, which would allow for more frequent monitoring.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Smartphone,,,,s21165437,research-article,

To compare the capabilities of two clinical classification systems, motor-phenotypes, and a simplified clinical motor-nonmotor subtyping system, a cohort was included at mean 7.9â€‰Â±â€‰5.3 years of disease duration, classified using both clinical systems, and reexamined and reclassified at the end of an observation period. Time-points were retrospectively extracted for five major disease milestones: death, dementia, Hoehn and Yahr stage 5, nursing home living, and walking aid use. Eighty-nine patients were observed for 8.1â€‰Â±â€‰2.7 years after inclusion. Dementia developed in 32.9% of the patients and 36.0â€“67.4% reached the other milestones. Motor-phenotypes were unable to stratify risks during this period, but the worst compared with the more favorable groups in the motor-nonmotor system conveyed hazard ratios between 2.6 and 63.6 for all milestones. A clear separation of risks for dying, living at the nursing home, and reaching motor end-stage was also shown when using only postural instability and gait disorder symptoms, without weighing them against the severity of the tremor. At reexamination, 29.4% and 64.7% of patients had changed classification groups in the motor-phenotype and motor-nonmotor systems, respectively. The motor-nonmotor system thus stratified risks of reaching crucial outcomes in midâ€“late Parkinsonâ€™s disease far better than the well-studied motor-phenotypes. Removing the tremor aspect of motor-phenotypes clearly improved this system, however. Classifications in both systems became unstable over time. The simplification of the motor-nonmotor system was easily applicable and showed potential as a prognostic marker during a large part of Parkinsonâ€™s disease.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor,Wearable,,,,s41531-021-00208-4,research-article,

Assessment in real-life conditions of subjective symptoms and objective metrics of mobility and nonmotor symptoms such as sleep disturbance is strongly advocated. This information would critically guide the adaptation of antiparkinsonian medications and nonpharmacological interventions. Moreover, since the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care practices are being reshaped toward a more home-based care. New technologies could play a pivotal role in this new approach to clinical care. Nevertheless, devices and information technology tools might be unhandy for PD patients, thus dramatically limiting their widespread employment. The goals of the research were development and usability evaluation of an application, SleepFit, for ecological momentary assessment of objective and subjective clinical metrics at PD patientsâ€™ homes, and as a remote tool for researchers to monitor patients and integrate and manage data. An iterative and user-centric strategy was employed for the development of SleepFit. The core structure of SleepFit consists of (1) an electronic finger-tapping test; (2) motor, sleepiness, and emotional subjective scales; and (3) a sleep diary. Applicable design, ergonomic, and navigation principles have been applied while tailoring the application to the specific patient population. Three progressively enhanced versions of the application (alpha, v1.0, v2.0) were tested by a total of 56 patients with PD who were asked to perform multiple home assessments 4 times per day for 2 weeks. Patient compliance was calculated as the proportion of completed tasks out of the total number of expected tasks. Satisfaction on the latest version (v2.0) was evaluated as potential willingness to use SleepFit again after the end of the study. From alpha to v1.0, SleepFit was improved in graphics, ergonomics, and navigation, with automated flows guiding the patients in performing tasks throughout the 24 hours, and real-time data collection and consultation were made possible thanks to a remote web portal. In v2.0, the kiosk-mode feature restricts the use of the tablet to the SleepFit application only, thus preventing users from accidentally exiting the application. A total of 52 (4 dropouts) patients were included in the analyses. Overall compliance (all versions) was 88.89% (5707/6420). SleepFit was progressively enhanced and compliance increased from 87.86% (2070/2356) to 89.92% (2899/3224; P =.04). Among the patients who used v2.0, 96% (25/26) declared they would use SleepFit again. SleepFit can be considered a state-of-the-art home-based system that increases compliance in PD patients, ensures high-quality data collection, and works as a handy tool for remote monitoring and data management in clinical research. Thanks to its user-friendliness and modular structure, it could be employed in other clinical studies with minimum adaptation efforts.

Vibrotactile coordinated reset (vCR) fingertip stimulation aims to counteract excessive synchronization and induce sustained unlearning of pathologic synaptic connectivity and neuronal synchrony. Here, we report two clinical feasibility studies that examine the effect of regular and noisy vCR stimulation on PD motor symptoms. Additionally, in one clinical study (study 1), we examine cortical beta band power changes in the sensorimotor cortex. Lastly, we compare these clinical results in relation to our computational findings. Study 1 examines six PD patients receiving noisy vCR stimulation and their cortical beta power changes after 3 months of daily therapy. Motor evaluations and at-rest electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were assessed off medication pre- and post-noisy vCR. Study 2 follows three patients for 6+ months, two of whom received daily regular vCR and one patient from study 1 who received daily noisy vCR. Motor evaluations were taken at baseline, and follow-up visits were done approximately every 3 months. Computationally , in a network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with spike timing-dependent plasticity, we study the differences between regular and noisy vCR by using a stimulus model that reproduces experimentally observed central neuronal phase locking. Clinically , in both studies, we observed significantly improved motor ability. EEG recordings observed from study 1 indicated a significant decrease in off-medication cortical sensorimotor high beta power (21â€”30 Hz) at rest after 3 months of daily noisy vCR therapy. Computationally , vCR and noisy vCR cause comparable parameter-robust long-lasting synaptic decoupling and neuronal desynchronization. In these feasibility studies of eight PD patients, regular vCR and noisy vCR were well tolerated, produced no side effects, and delivered sustained cumulative improvement of motor performance, which is congruent with our computational findings. In study 1, reduction of high beta band power over the sensorimotor cortex may suggest noisy vCR is effectively modulating the beta band at the cortical level, which may play a role in improved motor ability. These encouraging therapeutic results enable us to properly plan a proof-of-concept study.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,BioPotential,,,,fphys.2021.624317,research-article,

We developed a novel algorithm for unobtrusive and continuous UPDRS-III estimation at home using two wearable inertial sensors mounted on the wrist and ankle. We used the ensemble of three deep-learning models to detect UPDRS-III-related patterns from a combination of hand-crafted features, raw temporal signals, and their timeâ€“frequency representation. Specifically, we used a dual-channel, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for hand-crafted features, 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-LSTM for raw signals, and 2D CNN-LSTM for timeâ€“frequency data. We utilized transfer learning from activity recognition data and proposed a two-stage training for the CNN-LSTM networks to cope with the limited amount of data. The algorithm was evaluated on gyroscope data from 24 PwP as they performed different daily living activities. The estimated UPDRS-III scores had a correlation of and a mean absolute error of 5.95 with the clinical examination scores without requiring the patients to perform any specific tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of our algorithm for estimating PD severity scores unobtrusively at home. Such an algorithm could provide the required motor-complication measurements without unnecessary clinical visits and help the treating physician provide effective management of the disease.

Attitudes Toward the Use of Voice-Assisted Technologies Among People With Parkinson Disease: Findings From a Web-Based Survey,,2021,JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies,"Parkinson disease,mobile phone,telerehabilitation,eHealth","Speech problems are common in people living with Parkinson disease (PD), limiting communication and ultimately affecting their quality of life. Voice-assisted technology in health and care settings has shown some potential in small-scale studies to address such problems, with a retrospective analysis of user reviews reporting anecdotal communication effects and promising usability features when using this technology for people with a range of disabilities. However, there is a need for research to establish usersâ€™ perspectives on the potential contribution of voice-assisted technology for people with PD. This study aims to explore the attitudes toward the use of voice-assisted technology for people with PD. A survey was approved for dissemination by a national charity, Parkinsonâ€™s UK, to be completed on the web by people living with the condition. The survey elicited respondent demographics, PD features, voice difficulties, digital skill capability, smart technology use, voice-assisted technology ownership and use, confidentiality, and privacy concerns. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and summative content analysis of free-text responses. Of 290 participants, 79.0% (n=229) indicated that they or others had noticed changes in their speech or voice because of the symptoms of their condition. Digital skills and awareness were reported on 11 digital skills such as the ability to find a website you have visited before . Most participants (n=209, 72.1%) reported being able to perform at least 10 of these 11 tasks. Similarly, of 70.7% (n=205) participants who owned a voice-assisted device, most of them (166/205, 80.9%) used it regularly, with 31.3% (52/166) reporting that they used the technology specifically to address the needs associated with their PD. Of these 166 users, 54.8% (n=91) sometimes, rarely, or never had to repeat themselves when using the technology. When asked about speech changes since they started using it, 25% (27/108) of participants noticed having to repeat themselves less and 14.8% (16/108) perceived their speech to be clearer. Of the 290 respondents, 90.7% (n=263) were not concerned, or only slightly concerned, about privacy and confidentiality. Having been added to the homes of Western society, domestic voice assist devices are now available to assist those with communication problems. People with PD reported a high digital capability, albeit those who responded to a web-based survey. Most people have embraced voice-assisted technology, find it helpful and usable, and some have found benefit to their speech. Speech and language therapists may have a virtual ally that is already in the patientâ€™s home to support future therapy provision.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Speech topics,Other,,,,23006,research-article,
Simple Smartphone-Based Assessment of Gait Characteristics in Parkinson Disease: Validation Study,,2021,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"smartphone,gait,stride time (variability),validity,Parkinson disease","Parkinson disease (PD) is a common Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia. Patients with PD have multiple gait impairments that result in an increased risk of falls and diminished quality of life. Therefore, gait measurement is important for the management of PD. We previously developed a smartphone-based dual-task gait assessment that was validated in healthy adults. The aim of this study was to test the validity of this gait assessment in people with PD, and to examine the association between app-derived gait metrics and the clinical and functional characteristics of PD. Fifty-two participants with clinically diagnosed PD completed assessments of walking, Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A), and Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) rating scale tests. Participants followed multimedia instructions provided by the app to complete two 20-meter trials each of walking normally (single task) and walking while performing a serial subtraction dual task (dual task). Gait data were simultaneously collected with the app and gold-standard wearable motion sensors. Stride times and stride time variability were derived from the acceleration and angular velocity signal acquired from the internal motion sensor of the phone and from the wearable sensor system. High correlations were observed between the stride time and stride time variability derived from the app and from the gold-standard system ( r =0.98-0.99, P <.001), revealing excellent validity of the app-based gait assessment in PD. Compared with those from the single-task condition, the stride time ( F =14.1, P <.001) and stride time variability ( F =6.8, P =.008) in the dual-task condition were significantly greater. Participants who walked with greater stride time variability exhibited a greater UPDRS III total score (single task: Î²=.39, P <.001; dual task: Î²=.37, P =.01), HAM-A (single-task: Î²=.49, P =.007; dual-task: Î²=.48, P =.009), and HAM-D (single task: Î²=.44, P =.01; dual task: Î²=.49, P =.009). Moreover, those with greater dual-task stride time variability (Î²=.48, P =.001) or dual-task cost of stride time variability (Î²=.44, P =.004) exhibited lower MoCA scores. A smartphone-based gait assessment can be used to provide meaningful metrics of single- and dual-task gait that are associated with disease severity and functional outcomes in individuals with PD.",>30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Smartphone,,,,25451,research-article,

Gait analysis was carried out through a six-cameras stereophotogrammetric system synchronized with two force plates, an eight-channel surface electromyographic system, recording the activity of four muscles bilaterally: Rectus femoris, tibialis anterior (TA), biceps femoris, and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL). The peak of the envelope (PoE) and its occurrence within the gait cycle (position of the peak of the envelope, PPoE) were calculated. Frequency-domain posturographic parameters were extracted while standing still on a force plate in eyes open and closed conditions for 60 s. After the treatment with Equistasi Â® , the mid-low (0.5â€“0.75) Hz and mid-high (0.75â€“1 Hz) components associated with the vestibular and somatosensory systems, PoE and PPoE, displayed a shift toward the values registered on the controls. Furthermore, a correlation was found between changes in proprioception (power spectrum frequencies during the Romberg Test) and the activity of GL, BF (PoE), and TA (PPoE). Results of this study could provide a quantitative estimation of the effects of a neurorehabilitation device on the peripheral and central nervous system in PD.",20<n<=30,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,Video Recording,,,,s21020560,research-article,

Appropriate symptom monitoring can help to improve management and medical treatments and improve the patientsâ€™ quality of life. Currently, tremor is evaluated by physical examinations during clinical appointments; however, this method could be subjective and does not represent the full spectrum of the symptom in the patientsâ€™ daily lives. In recent years, sensor-based systems have been used to obtain objective information about the disease. However, most of these systems require the use of multiple devices, which makes it difficult to use them in an ambulatory setting. This paper presents a novel approach to evaluate the amplitude and constancy of resting tremor using triaxial accelerometers from consumer smartwatches and multitask classification models. These approaches are used to develop a system for an automated and accurate symptom assessment without interfering with the patientsâ€™ daily lives. Results show a high agreement between the amplitude and constancy measurements obtained from the smartwatch in comparison with those obtained in a clinical assessment. This indicates that consumer smartwatches in combination with multitask convolutional neural networks are suitable for providing accurate and relevant information about tremor in patients in the early stages of the disease, which can contribute to the improvement of PD clinical evaluation, early detection of the disease, and continuous monitoring.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor,Wearable,,,,s21010291,research-article,

Methods: According to previous studies, a total of 256 patients with de novo PD were classified using the tremor-dominant/mixed/akinetic-rigid (TD/mixed/AR), TD/indeterminate/postural instability and gait disturbance (PIGD), and predominantly TD/predominantly PIGD (p-TD/p-PIGD) classification systems. Results: Among the TD/mixed/AR subgroups, the patients with the AR subtype obtained more severe motor scores than the patients with the TD subtype. Among the TD/indeterminate/PIGD subgroups and between the p-TD and p-PIGD subgroups, the patients with the PIGD/p-PIGD subtype obtained more severe scores related to activities of daily living (ADL), motor and non-motor symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and sleep impairment, than the patients with the TD/p-TD subtype. Furthermore, symptoms in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and miscellaneous domains of the Non-motor Questionnaire (NMSQuest) were more prevalent in the patients with the PIGD/p-PIGD subtypes than the patients with the TD/p-TD subtypes. Conclusions: The PIGD/p-PIGD subtypes had more severe ADL, motor and non-motor symptoms than the TD/p-TD subtypes.

Neuromechanical Assessment of Activated vs. Resting Leg Rigidity Using the Pendulum Test Is Associated With a Fall History in People With Parkinsonâ€™s Disease,"Martino, Giovanni; McKay, J. Lucas; Factor, Stewart A.; Ting, Lena H.",2020,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"hyperreflexia,EMG,kinematics,dual-task,activation maneuver,biomechanics,hyper-resistance,neural control","Leg rigidity is associated with frequent falls in people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), suggesting a potential role in functional balance and gait impairments. Changes in the neural state due to secondary tasks, e.g., activation maneuvers, can exacerbate (or â€œactivateâ€) rigidity, possibly increasing the risk of falls. However, the subjective interpretation and coarse classification of the standard clinical rigidity scale has prohibited the systematic, objective assessment of resting and activated leg rigidity. The pendulum test is an objective diagnostic method that we hypothesized would be sensitive enough to characterize resting and activated leg rigidity. We recorded kinematic data and electromyographic signals from rectus femoris and biceps femoris during the pendulum test in 15 individuals with PD, spanning a range of leg rigidity severity. From the recorded data of leg swing kinematics, we measured biomechanical outcomes including first swing excursion, first extension peak, number and duration of the oscillations, resting angle, relaxation index, maximum and minimum angular velocity. We examined associations between biomechanical outcomes and clinical leg rigidity score. We evaluated the effect of increasing rigidity through activation maneuvers on biomechanical outcomes. Finally, we assessed whether either biomechanical outcomes or changes in outcomes with activation were associated with a fall history. Our results suggest that the biomechanical assessment of the pendulum test can objectively quantify parkinsonian leg rigidity. We found that the presence of high rigidity during clinical exam significantly impacted biomechanical outcomes, i.e., first extension peak, number of oscillations, relaxation index, and maximum angular velocity. No differences in the effect of activation maneuvers between groups with clinically assessed low rigidity were observed, suggesting that activated rigidity may be independent of resting rigidity and should be scored as independent variables. Moreover, we found that fall history was more common among people whose rigidity was increased with a secondary task, as measured by biomechanical outcomes. We conclude that different mechanisms contributing to resting and activated rigidity may play an important yet unexplored functional role in balance impairments. The pendulum test may contribute to a better understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying motor symptoms in PD, evaluating the efficacy of treatments, and predicting the risk of falls.",10<n<=20,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Limb movements,BioPotential,,,,fnhum.2020.602595,research-article,
Smartphone-Based Monitoring of Parkinson Disease: Quasi-Experimental Study to Quantify Hand Tremor Severity and Medication Effectiveness,,2020,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"Parkinson disease,smartphone,hand tremor,mobile health","Hand tremor typically has a negative impact on a personâ€™s ability to complete many common daily activities. Previous research has investigated how to quantify hand tremor with smartphones and wearable sensors, mainly under controlled data collection conditions. Solutions for daily real-life settings remain largely underexplored. Our objective was to monitor and assess hand tremor severity in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and to better understand the effects of PD medications in a naturalistic environment. Using the Welch method, we generated periodograms of accelerometer data and computed signal features to compare patients with varying degrees of PD symptoms. We introduced and empirically evaluated the tremor intensity parameter (TIP), an accelerometer-based metric to quantify hand tremor severity in PD using smartphones. There was a statistically significant correlation between the TIP and self-assessed Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II tremor scores (Kendall rank correlation test: z=30.521, P <.001, Ï„=0.5367379; n=11). An analysis of the â€œbeforeâ€ and â€œafterâ€ medication intake conditions identified a significant difference in accelerometer signal characteristics among participants with different levels of rigidity and bradykinesia (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P <.05). Our work demonstrates the potential use of smartphone inertial sensors as a systematic symptom severity assessment mechanism to monitor PD symptoms and to assess medication effectiveness remotely. Our smartphone-based monitoring app may also be relevant for other conditions where hand tremor is a prevalent symptom.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor,Smartphone,,,,21543,research-article,

Innovative predictive analysing methods hold potential to develop a tool for clinicians that reliably predicts individual postoperative motor response, by only regarding clinical preoperative variables. The main aim of preoperative prediction would be to improve preoperative patient counselling, expectation management, and postoperative patient satisfaction. We developed a machine learning logistic regression prediction model which generates probabilities for experiencing weak motor response one year after surgery. The model analyses preoperative variables and is trained on 89 patients using a five-fold cross-validation. Imaging and neurophysiology data are left out intentionally to ensure usability in the preoperative clinical practice. Weak responders ( n Â =Â 30) were defined as patients who fail to show clinically relevant improvement on Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale II, III or IV. The model predicts weak responders with an average area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.79 (standard deviation: 0.08), a true positive rate of 0.80 and a false positive rate of 0.24, and a diagnostic accuracy of 78%. The reported influences of individual preoperative variables are useful for clinical interpretation of the model, but cannot been interpreted separately regardless of the other variables in the model. The modelâ€™s diagnostic accuracy confirms the utility of machine learning based motor response prediction based on clinical preoperative variables.

However, increasing the number of devices worn on the body adds to the patient burden and impacts the compliance. This study aimed to investigate the impact of reducing the number of wearable devices on the ability to assess gait impairments in patients with PD. A total of 35 volunteers with PD and 60 healthy volunteers performed a gait task during 2 clinic visits. Participants with PD were assessed in the On and Off medication state using the Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia Society version of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Gait features derived from a single lumbar-mounted accelerometer were compared with those derived using 3 and 6 wearable devices for both participants with PD and healthy participants. A comparable performance was observed for predicting the MDS-UPDRS gait score using longitudinal mixed-effects model fit with gait features derived from a single (root mean square error [RMSE]=0.64; R2=0.53), 3 (RMSE=0.64; R2=0.54), and 6 devices (RMSE=0.54; R2=0.65). In addition, MDS-UPDRS gait scores predicted using all 3 models differed significantly between On and Off motor states (single device, P =.004; 3 devices, P =.004; 6 devices, P =.045). We observed a marginal benefit in using multiple devices for assessing gait impairments in patients with PD when compared with gait features derived using a single lumbar-mounted accelerometer.

We aimed to assess the evolution of parkinsonian characteristics in PPAOS patients who had been followed yearly for at least six years. From a large cohort of 46 PPAOS patients, eight were followed yearly for > 6-years in multiple NIH-funded grants. Parkinsonian and other features, including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, postural instability, apraxia, ocular motor function and cognition were assessed at each visit, and research criteria applied for PSP and CBS diagnosis. Neurological, speech-language test scores, and [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) and MRI midbrain volumes were assessed. A Parkinsonâ€™s plus syndrome developed in all eight patients (100%). Bradykinesia was the earliest feature, followed by rigidity and postural instability. Tremor was not a significant feature.

To test the feasibility, safety, and signal of efficacy of a mobile app that facilitates exercise for people with Parkinson disease. A prospective, single-cohort design of people with Parkinson disease who had downloaded the 9zest app for exercise was used for this 12-week pilot study. Participants, who were recruited online, were encouraged to exercise with the full automated app for â‰¥150 minutes each week. The primary endpoints were feasibility (app usage and usability questions) and safety (adverse events and falls). The primary endpoints for signal of efficacy were a comparison of the in-app baseline and 8-week outcomes on the 30-second Sit-To-Stand (STS) test, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and the Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Questionnaire 8 (PDQ8). For feasibility, of the 28 participants that completed the study, 12 participants averaged >150 minutes of app usage per week (3 averaged 120-150, 4 averaged 90-120, and 9 averaged less than 90 minutes). A majority of participants (>74%) felt the exercise was of value (16/19; 9 nonrespondents), provided adequate instruction (14/19; 9 nonrespondents), and was appropriate for level of function (16/19; 9 nonrespondents). For safety, there were no serious adverse events that occurred during the app-guided exercise. There were 4 reports of strain/sprain injuries while using the app among 3 participants, none of which necessitated medical attention. For signal of efficacy, there was improvement for each of the primary endpoints: STS ( P =.01), TUG ( P <.001), and PDQ8 ( P =.01). Independent, video-guided exercise using a mobile app designed for exercise in Parkinson disease was safe and feasible though there was variability in app usage. Despite this, the results provide evidence for a signal of efficacy as there were improvements in 3 of the 3 outcomes.

There was a trend for higher risk of falls in patients with orthostatic mean arterial pressure â‰¤75 mmHg. Kinematic but not clinical measures predicted falls in PD patients with OH.

How People with Parkinson's Disease and Health Care Professionals Wish to Partner in Care Using eHealth: Co-Design Study,,2020,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"chronic care,Parkinson's disease,co-creation,co-design,participatory design,eHealth,mHealth,clinical decision support","Worldwide, the number of people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is predicted to double between the years 2005 and 2030. Chronic care management requires active collaboration and knowledge exchange between patients and health care professionals (HCPs) for best possible health outcomes, which we describe as co-care. eHealth services have the potential to support the realization of co-care between people with PD (PwP) and HCPs. This study aimed to explore how co-care could be operationalized in PD care, supported by eHealth. More specifically, this study explores PwP's and HCPs' expectations and desired eHealth functionalities to achieve co-care. Principles of participatory design were used to enable the identification of co-care needs and design ideas, in a series of 4 half-day co-design workshops. The sample included 7 (4 women) PwP and 9 (4 women) HCPs, including 4 neurologists, 3 nurses, and 2 physiotherapists. The co-design process resulted in a functional prototype that was evaluated by the co-design participants in the last workshop. Data were collected through note cards produced by the participants during the first 3 workshops and focus group discussions during the 3rd and 4th workshops. The data were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. After the workshop series, the prototype was demonstrated at a Mini Fair for ongoing PD research and evaluated using a self-developed questionnaire with 37 respondents: 31 PwP (14 women) and 6 informal caregivers (3 women). Descriptive statistics are reported. The qualitative analysis of data resulted in 2 main themes. The first theme, core eHealth functionalities and their expected values, describes 6 desired eHealth functionalities for supporting PD co-care between PwP and HCPs: (1) self-tracking, (2) previsit forms, (3) graphical visualization, (4) clinical decision support, (5) self-care recommendations, and (6) asynchronous communication. The second theme, individual and organizational constraints, describes constraints that need to be addressed to succeed with an eHealth service for co-care. Individual constraints include eHealth literacy and acceptance; organizational constraints include teamwork and administrative workload. The majority of the questionnaire respondents (31/37, 84%) perceived that they would benefit from an eHealth service similar to the demonstrated prototype. All prototype functionalities were rated as very important or important by the majority of respondents (ranging from 86% to 97% per functionality). This study adds to our knowledge on how PD co-care could be operationalized. Co-care implies a shift from episodic routine-driven care to more flexible care management that is driven by the mutual needs of patients and HCPs and supported by active information exchange between them, as well as automated information processing to generate patient-specific advice. More research is needed to further explore the concept of co-care in chronic care management and what it means for self-care and health care.

However, mobile-health services (mHealth) are currently in the initial stage, and have not yet prevailed in China. Additionally, the prevalence of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) in China is 1700/100,000 (â‰¥65â€‰years). Indeed, these PD patients would benefit from mHealth to manage their disease. Therefore, we designed a study to determine attitudes toward smartphone applications (apps) for chronic condition self-management, and to discover the practicality of these apps among PD patients in China. We selected 204 participants with PD between 52 and 87â€‰years old and surveyed their attitudes concerning the use of smartphone apps for chronic condition management via questionnaires. Among the participants, 65.19% had smartphones. Among these smartphone users, 82.84% expressed a preference for using apps for PD management. This group tended to be younger and more frequent web users with higher education and better medication compliance, and they tended to have a longer PD course and worse conditions ( P â€‰<â€‰0.001, Pâ€‰= Â 0.001, P â€‰<â€‰0.001, P â€‰=â€‰0.041, P â€‰<â€‰0.001, P â€‰=â€‰0.013).

Lower Energy Intake among Advanced vs. Early Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Patients and Healthy Controls in a Clinical Lunch Setting: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Fagerberg, Petter; Klingelhoefer, Lisa; Bottai, Matteo; Langlet, Billy; Kyritsis, Konstantinos; Rotter, Eva; Reichmann, Heinz; Falkenburger, BjÃ¶rn; Delopoulos, Anastasios; Ioakimidis, Ioannis",2020,Nutrients,"Parkinsonâ€™s disease,energy intake,food,monitoring,eating behavior,weight loss,neurodegenerative diseases,malnutrition","Unintentional weight loss has been observed among Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) patients. Changes in energy intake (EI) and eating behavior, potentially caused by fine motor dysfunction and eating-related symptoms, might contribute to this. The primary aim of this study was to investigate differences in objectively measured EI between groups of healthy controls (HC), early (ESPD) and advanced stage PD patients (ASPD) during a standardized lunch in a clinical setting. The secondary aim was to identify clinical features and eating behavior abnormalities that explain EI differences. All participants ( n = 23 HC, n = 20 ESPD, and n = 21 ASPD) went through clinical evaluations and were eating a standardized meal (200 g sausages, 400 g potato salad, 200 g apple purÃ©e and 500 mL water) in front of two video cameras. Participants ate freely, and the food was weighed pre- and post-meal to calculate EI (kcal). Multiple linear regression was used to explain group differences in EI. ASPD had a significantly lower EI vs. HC (âˆ’162 kcal, p < 0.05) and vs. ESPD (âˆ’203 kcal, p < 0.01) when controlling for sex. The number of spoonfuls, eating problems, dysphagia and upper extremity tremor could explain most (86%) of the lower EI vs. HC, while the first three could explain ~50% vs. ESPD. Food component intake analysis revealed significantly lower potato salad and sausage intakes among ASPD vs. both HC and ESPD, while water intake was lower vs. HC. EI is an important clinical target for PD patients with an increased risk of weight loss. Our results suggest that interventions targeting upper extremity tremor, spoonfuls, dysphagia and eating problems might be clinically useful in the prevention of unintentional weight loss in PD. Since EI was lower in ASPD, EI might be a useful marker of disease progression in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor,Other,,,,nu12072109,research-article,

Levels of LID, tremor and bradykinesia were measured during best-ON state in 121 patients diagnosed with PD and having peak-dose LID using inertial sensors positioned on each body limb. Rigidity and postural instability were assessed using clinical evaluations. Cognition and depression were assessed using the MMSE and the GDS-15. Participation in active life was assessed in patients and in 69 healthy controls using the Activity Card Sort (ACS), which measures levels of activity engagement and activities affected by the symptomatology. Outcome measures were compared between patients and controls using ANCOVA, controlling for age or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Spearman correlations and multivariate analyses were then performed between symptomatology and ACS scores. Patients had significantly lower activity engagement than controls and had significantly affected activities. LID was neither associated with activity engagement nor affected activities. Higher levels of tremor, postural instability, cognitive decline and depression were associated with lower activity engagement and higher affected activities. Multivariate analyses revealed that only tremor, postural instability and depression accounted significantly in the variances of these variables. Slight-to-moderate LID had little impact compared to other symptoms on the level of participation in active life, suggesting that other symptoms should remain the treatment priority to maintain the level of participation of patients in an active lifestyle.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Tremor,Wearable,,,,tohm.403,research-article,

Methods: 47 non-demented patients with PD were examined and re-examined after 3 years. At both time-points, the patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological assessment and EEG in eyes-closed resting-state condition. The results of cognitive tests were normalized and individually summarized to obtain a â€œglobal cognitive scoreâ€ (GCS). Change of GCS was used to represent cognitive changes over time. GRMPT and SAILR was used for further analysis. Linear regression models were calculated. Results: GRMPT and SAILR independently predicted cognitive change. Combination of GRMPT and SAILR improved the significance of the regression model as compared to using each of these measures alone. GRMPT and SAILR only slightly correlate between each other. Conclusion: The combination of axial signs and rigidity with quantitative EEG improves early identification of patients with PD prone to severe cognitive decline. GRMPT and SAILR seem to reflect different disease mechanisms.

Gait impairment is a major motor symptom for patients suffering from neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x2019;s disease (PD), and serves as an important indicator for early screening and diagnosis of the disease. Existing gait analysis methods typically require advanced equipment, trained professionals, and complex procedures. In this paper, we propose a method to classify the abnormal gait of patients suffering from Parkinson&#x2019;s disease and normal gait, solely with the 2D walking videos recorded by a common camera or a smartphone. A pose estimation algorithm is employed to extract the skeleton of the subjects from the videos. Based on the analysis of motor disturbances resulting from Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, specific gait features are defined and extracted, including step length, walking speed, arm swing magnitude, and velocity. Considering that the sample size of clinical data is limited in the early stage, classic classifiers are applied, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The registered clinical study was conducted with 20 PD patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls. With the three classifiers, 87.5% (LR), 90.0% (SVM), and 92.5% (RF) of classification accuracy were achieved, respectively. Thus, video-based classification of abnormal gait promises a solution for remote screening and diagnosis of neurological diseases.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,Video Recording,,,,ccc52363.2021.9549992,IEEE Conferences,

The device includes one actuated joint and four passive revolute joints with a high overall intrinsic backdriveability. In order to allow the user to freely move the wrist during activities of daily living, we implemented a transparent controller on the basis of the interaction force sensed by the embedded load cell. Conversely, in order to provide perturbations for estimating the wrist flexion-extension rigidity, we implemented a torque controller. Firstly, we report a pilot study that aimed at characterizing the device in terms of range of motion (ROM) allowed, transparency perceived and torque-tracking capability. Then, we present a case study in which we tested our device with seven PD patients in both drug-OFF and drug-ON conditions and we compared the measured stiffness with the one measured in fourteen healthy controls and with the outcome of the most used clinical scale (MDS-UPDRS). The device allowed to successfully estimate the stiffness as different depending on the movement direction. Indeed, extension stiffness was higher than the flexion one, accordingly to the literature. Moreover, the device allowed to discriminate both Healthy subjects from PD subjects, and PD subjects in OFF condition from PD subjects in ON condition.

Neurologists assess the severity of PD motor symptoms using the clinical rating scale, i.e., MDS-UPDRS. However, this assessment method is time-consuming and easily affected by the perception difference of assessors. In the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, telemedicine for PD has become extremely urgent for clinical practice. To solve these problems, we developed an automated and objective assessment method of the leg agility task in the MDS-UPDRS using videos and a graph neural network. In this study, a sparse adaptive graph convolutional network (SA-GCN) was proposed to achieve fine-grained quantitative assessment of skeleton sequences extracted from videos. Specifically, the sparse adaptive graph convolutional unit with a prior knowledge constraint was proposed to perform adaptive spatial modeling of physical and logical dependency for skeleton sequences, thus achieving the sparse modeling of the discriminative spatial relationships. Subsequently, a temporal context module was introduced to construct the remote context dependency in the temporal dimension, hence determining the global changes of the task. A multi-domain attention learning module was also developed to integrate the static spatial features and dynamic temporal features, and then to emphasize the salient feature selection in the channel domain, thereby capturing the multi-domain fine-grained information. Finally, the evaluation results using a dataset with 148 patients and 870 samples confirmed the effectiveness and reliability of our scheme, and the method outperformed other related state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional PD assessment is conducted by a physician during infrequent clinic visits. Using smartphones, remote patient monitoring has the potential to obtain objective behavioral data semi-continuously, track disease fluctuations, and avoid rater dependency. Methods: Smartphones collect sensor data during various active tests and passive monitoring, including balance (postural instability), dexterity (skill in performing tasks using hands), gait (the pattern of walking), tremor (involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation), and voice. Some of the features extracted from smartphone data are potentially associated with specific PD symptoms identified by physicians. To leverage large-scale cross-modality smartphone features, we propose a machine-learning framework for performing automated disease assessment. The framework consists of a two-step feature selection procedure and a generic model based on the elastic-net regularization. Results: Using this framework, we map the PD-specific architecture of behaviors using data obtained from both PD participants and healthy controls (HCs). Utilizing these atlases of features, the framework shows promises to (a) discriminate PD participants from HCs, and (b) estimate the disease severity of individuals with PD. Significance: Data analysis results from 437 behavioral features obtained from 72 subjects (37 PD and 35 HC) sampled from 17 separate days during a period of up to six months suggest that this framework is potentially useful for the analysis of remotely collected smartphone sensor data in individuals with PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,,Smartphone,,,,tbme.2020.2988942,IEEE Journals,

This paper describes a new data analysis approach that can be used along with two wearable IMU (inertial measurement units) sensors to continuously assess motor fluctuations in PD patients while moving in their natural environment. We hypothesized that joint analysis of the sensor data in its spectral, temporal and sensor domain could generate multilevel features that can be used to detect PD-related patterns successfully as the subject's motor state fluctuates between medication ON and OFF states. For this purpose, we utilized time-frequency (TF) representation and multiway data analysis tools (i.e., tensor decomposition) to decompose the TF representation of the two sensors' data into its multilevel structures, which were next used to extract multilevel features representing the PD symptoms in different medication states. The extracted multilevel features were used in a classification model based on support vector machine to detect medication ON and OFF states. For comparison purposes, we implemented a traditional feature extraction method. We also developed a hierarchical feature extraction method based on the combination of those two methods. The performances of the three methods were evaluated using a dataset of 19 PD subjects with a total duration of 17.54 hours. The multilevel features achieved 8.25% improvement in the accuracy over the traditional features, and the hierarchical features resulted in 10.73% improvement indicating that our approach holds great promise to continuously detect medication states from continuous monitoring of the subjects' movement.

We propose to tackle the problem as a semi-supervised anomaly detection task, where we model the physiological patterns of healthy subjects instead.

Often, body-sensor networks with inertial measurement units (IMU) used in rehabilitation and ambient monitoring of patients with Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias, require specific markings or labels for the correct body placement. This introduces a burden, which, especially for ambient monitoring, could lead to errors or reduced adherence. We propose a method to automatically identify sensors attached on a predefined set of body placements, namely, wrists, shanks and torso. The method was used in a multi-site clinical trial with Parkinson's disease patients and in 45 sessions it identified sensor placement on torso, wrists and shanks with 100% accuracy, discriminated between left and right shank with 100% accuracy and between left and right wrist with 98% accuracy. This is remarkable, considering the presence of parkinsonian motor symptoms causing abnormal movement patterns, such as dyskinesia.Clinical Relevance- This method can facilitate home monitoring of patients with Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Activities of Daily Living,Wearable,,,,embc44109.2020.9175913,IEEE Conferences,
Using Polar Expression Features and Nonlinear Machine Learning Classifier for Automated Parkinson's Disease Screening,T. Yang; P. Kan; C. Lin; H. Lin; W. Chen; H. Yau,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,Polar expression feature;deviation;accumulation angle;drawing velocity;nonlinear support vector machine,"Analyzing digitalized hand-drawn patterns, such as Archimedes' spirals, words, and sentences, is one strategy for evaluating functional tremors and upper-limb Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias for neurodegenerative diseases. A pattern, such as a spiral or a line, in polar coordinates is a straight line or a curve that can be easily compared to a hand-drawn pattern with the same coordinates. Hence, in this study, using polar expression features, the deviation (cm), the accumulation angle (rad), and the drawing velocity (cm/s) were extracted to scale the variability in different tremor levels associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) or essential tremor (ET). Then, a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier was used to separate the normal condition from PD or ET. The classifier was trained by the wolf pack search (WPS) optimization method. Tremor level progress was evaluated by integrating an assistive method in a smart mobile device (iPad), along with the nonlinear SVM-based classifier, into a decision-making system for individualized functions. In contrast to the multilayer machine learning method, with the 8-fold cross-validation, the proposed classifier exhibits superior performance in identifying normal controls and PD or ET, with the mean true positive, mean true negative, and mean hit rates being 93.72%, 86.79%, and 90.84%, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the proposed decision-making method is effective for detecting the progression of Parkinson-related diseases. This examination technique is simple, comfortable, and repeatable for helping neurologists with preliminary diagnoses, drug treatments, and at-home monitoring.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Handwritting,Other,,,,jsen.2019.2940694,IEEE Journals,

Horak; J. McNames,2021,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,Turning;inertial sensors;mobility;Parkinson's disease (PD);Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA);healthy controls (HC),"Background: One difficulty in turning algorithm design for inertial sensors is detecting two discrete turns in the same direction, close in time. A second difficulty is under-estimation of turn angle due to short-duration hesitations by people with neurological disorders. We aimed to validate and determine the generalizability of a: I. Discrete Turn Algorithm for variable and sequential turns close in time and II: Merged Turn Algorithm for a single turn angle in the presence of hesitations. Methods: We validated the Discrete Turn Algorithm with motion capture in healthy controls (HC, n = 10) performing a spectrum of turn angles. Subsequently, the generalizability of the Discrete Turn Algorithm and associated, Merged Turn Algorithm were tested in people with Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 124), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, n = 51), and HC (n = 125). Results: The Discrete Turn Algorithm shows improved agreement with optical motion capture and with known turn angles, compared to our previous algorithm by El-Gohary et al. The Merged Turn algorithm that merges consecutive turns in the same direction with short hesitations resulted in turn angle estimates closer to a fixed 180-degree turn angle in the PD, SCA, and HC subjects compared to our previous turn algorithm. Additional metrics were proposed to capture turn hesitations in PD and SCA. Conclusion: The Discrete Turn Algorithm may be particularly useful to characterize turns when the turn angle is unknown, i.e., during free-living conditions. The Merged Turn algorithm is recommended for clinical tasks in which the single-turn angle is known, especially for patients who hesitate while turning.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Activities of Daily Living,Wearable,,,,tbme.2020.3037820,IEEE Journals,

Abbasi,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,Radar sensing;Wi-Fi sensing;deep learning;FOG detection,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and neurodegenerative condition causing motor impairments. One of the major motor related impairments that present biggest challenge is freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's patients. In FOG episode, the patient is unable to initiate, control or sustain a gait that consequently affects the Activities of Daily Livings (ADLs) and increases the occurrence of critical events such as falls. This paper presents continuous monitoring ADLs and classification freezing of gait episodes using Wi-Fi and radar imaging. The idea is to exploit the multi-resolution scalograms generated by channel state information (CSI) imprint and micro-Doppler signatures produced by reflected radar signal. A total of 120 volunteers took part in experimental campaign and were asked to perform different activities including walking fast, walking slow, voluntary stop, sitting down & stand up and freezing of gait. Two neural networks namely Autoencoder and a proposed enhanced Autoencoder were used classify ADLs and FOG episodes using data fusion process by combining the images acquired from both sensing techniques.

EEG Activity Related to Decrease in Persistency of Gait Cycle Variability during Distracted Walking,A. Nakamura; Y. Suzuki; S. Yano; T. Nomura,2021,2021 IEEE 3rd Global Conference on Life Sciences and Technologies (LifeTech),gait cycle variability;gait stability;cognitive load;electroencephalogram,"Human gait cycle fluctuates during walking even with a constant walking speed. Such fluctuation, referred to as the gait cycle variability, is often quantified by measuring stride intervals, i.e., time intervals between one and the subsequent heel contacts of one of the feet. It has been known that gait cycle variability in healthy young people exhibits a positive persistency, which tends to be lost by aging and neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease, suggesting that the positive persistency reflects endogenous stability of gait. We have reported previously that the degree of positive persistency decreased during distracted walking with smartphone-gaming induced cognitive load. Here, we hypothesized that the decrease in the positive persistency is caused by a change in the neural activity at supra-spinal level. To find evidence for this hypothesis, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) during walking with and without the cognitive load. As a result, though preliminary, amplitude of the EEG at gamma band increased at a timing prior to every heel contact in the cognitive load condition compared to the control condition. This preliminary result suggests that a supra-spinal gait control mechanism is involved in the gait cycle variability.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait,BioPotential,,,,lifetech52111.2021.9391888,IEEE Conferences,

This work uses machine learning approaches for analyzing the data of one single body-worn inertial sensor system to classify and detect FOG. Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) is employed as the FOG detection algorithm and the Daphnet (FOG and normal gait) dataset provides the data for model training and testing in this paper. The model considers raw data from three channels of the acceleration sensor mounted on the patient's shank and ignores all other data from other sensors. The model is patient dependent and uses sensitivity and specificity metrics to evaluate the model's performance. In this paper, we propose a novel padding method that is applied to the windows of FOG and non-FOG with zero overlaps on the training set and adapts the padding to the individual regions. This method produces windows of only one type of data and label. The proposed padding method reduces the padding amount by two orders of magnitude compared to bigger batch sizes in the sequence splitting method offered by MATLAB 2019a. The padding amount is independent of the batch size. Raw data is fed to the model in the testing mode without any pre-processing or data transformation. The standard rolling window generates fixed-size windows for the test set without overlap and the higher amount of FOG or Normal walking data which defines the label of the individual window.

Neuronal Dynamics of Pain in Parkinson's Disease,"Kinugawa, Kaoru; Mano, Tomoo; Sugie, Kazuma",2021,Brain Sciences,pain; Parkinson's disease; electroencephalography; neuronal synchronization,"Pain is an important non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). It negatively impacts the quality of life. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pain in PD remain to be elucidated. This study sought to use electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence analysis to compare neuronal synchronization in neuronal networks between patients with PD, with and without pain. Twenty-four patients with sporadic PD were evaluated for the presence of pain. Time-frequency and coherence analyses were performed on their EEG data. Whole-brain and regional coherence were calculated and compared between pain-positive and pain-negative patients. There was no significant difference in the whole-brain coherence between the pain-positive and pain-negative groups. However, temporal-temporal coherence differed significantly between the two groups (p = 0.031). Our findings indicate that aberrant synchronization of inter-temporal regions is involved in PD-related pain. This will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain in PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Pain,BioPotential,,,,brainsci11091224,Brief Report,
Wearable Inertial Gait Algorithms: Impact of Wear Location and Environment in Healthy and Parkinson's Populations,"Celik, Yunus; Stuart, Sam; Woo, Wai; Godfrey, Alan",2021,Sensors,gait analysis; wearable electronic devices; computing methodologies; patient outcome assessment,"Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used in gait analysis due to their discrete wearable attachment and long data recording possibilities within indoor and outdoor environments. Previously, lower back and shin/shank-based IMU algorithms detecting initial and final contact events (ICs-FCs) were developed and validated on a limited number of healthy young adults (YA), reporting that both IMU wear locations are suitable to use during indoor and outdoor gait analysis. However, the impact of age (e.g., older adults, OA), pathology (e.g., Parkinson's Disease, PD) and/or environment (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) on algorithm accuracy have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined IMU gait data from 128 participants (72-YA, 20-OA, and 36-PD) to thoroughly investigate the suitability of ICs-FCs detection algorithms (1 Ãƒâ€” lower back and 1 Ãƒâ€” shin/shank-based) for quantifying temporal gait characteristics depending on IMU wear location and walking environment. The level of agreement between algorithms was investigated for different cohorts and walking environments. Although mean temporal characteristics from both algorithms were significantly correlated for all groups and environments, subtle but characteristically nuanced differences were observed between cohorts and environments. The lowest absolute agreement level was observed in PD (ICC2,1 = 0.979, 0.806, 0.730, 0.980) whereas highest in YA (ICC2,1 = 0.987, 0.936, 0.909, 0.989) for mean stride, stance, swing, and step times, respectively. Absolute agreement during treadmill walking (ICC2,1 = 0.975, 0.914, 0.684, 0.945), indoor walking (ICC2,1 = 0.987, 0.936, 0.909, 0.989) and outdoor walking (ICC2,1 = 0.998, 0.940, 0.856, 0.998) was found for mean stride, stance, swing, and step times, respectively. Findings of this study suggest that agreements between algorithms are sensitive to the target cohort and environment. Therefore, researchers/clinicians should be cautious while interpreting temporal parameters that are extracted from inertial sensors-based algorithms especially for those with a neurological condition.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait analysis,Wearable,,,,s21196476,Article,
An Inertial Sensor-Based Gait Analysis Pipeline for the Assessment of Real-World Stair Ambulation Parameters,"Roth, Nils; KÃƒÂ¼derle, Arne; Prossel, Dominik; Gassner, Heiko; Eskofier, Bjoern; Kluge, Felix",2021,Sensors,HMM; IMU; segmentation; ascending; descending; classification; trajectory; ETKF; ZUPT; free-living,"Climbing stairs is a fundamental part of daily life, adding additional demands on the postural control system compared to level walking. Although real-world gait analysis studies likely contain stair ambulation sequences, algorithms dedicated to the analysis of such activities are still missing. Therefore, we propose a new gait analysis pipeline for foot-worn inertial sensors, which can segment, parametrize, and classify strides from continuous gait sequences that include level walking, stair ascending, and stair descending. For segmentation, an existing approach based on the hidden Markov model and a feature-based gait event detection were extended, reaching an average segmentation F1 score of 98.5% and gait event timing errors below Ã‚Â±10ms for all conditions. Stride types were classified with an accuracy of 98.2% using spatial features derived from a Kalman filter-based trajectory reconstruction. The evaluation was performed on a dataset of 20 healthy participants walking on three different staircases at different speeds. The entire pipeline was additionally validated end-to-end on an independent dataset of 13 Parkinson's disease patients. The presented work aims to extend real-world gait analysis by including stair ambulation parameters in order to gain new insights into mobility impairments that can be linked to clinically relevant conditions such as a patient's fall risk and disease state or progression.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait analysis,Activities of Daily Living",Wearable,,,,s21196559,Article,

Wearables facilitate measurements of gait in novel and unsupervised environments; however, differences between unsupervised and in-laboratory measures have been reported in PD. We aimed to investigate whether unsupervised gait speed discriminates medication states and which supervised tests most accurately represent home performance. In-lab gait speeds from different gait tasks were compared to home speeds of 27 PD patients at ON and OFF states using inertial sensors. Daily gait speed distribution was expressed in percentiles and walking bout (WB) length. Gait speeds differentiated ON and OFF states in the lab and the home. When comparing lab with home performance, ON assessments in the lab showed moderate-to-high correlations with faster gait speeds in unsupervised environment (r = 0.69; p &lt; 0.001), associated with long WB. OFF gait assessments in the lab showed moderate correlation values with slow gait speeds during OFF state at home (r = 0.56; p = 0.004), associated with short WB. In-lab and daily assessments of gait speed with wearables capture additional integrative aspects of PD, reflecting different aspects of mobility.

The most important research results presented in this article are the developed approaches for the processing of patient voices and the use of genetic algorithms to select the architecture of the neural network in the monitoring system for patients with Parkinson's disease. The process used to pre-process a person's voice is described in order to determine the main parameters that can be used in assessing a person's condition. It is shown that the efficiency of using genetic algorithms for constructing neural networks depends on the composition of the data.

Monitoring the patient&rsquo;s condition and its compliance is the key to the success of the correction of the main clinical manifestations of PD, including the almost inevitable modification of the clinical picture of the disease against the background of prolonged dopaminergic therapy. In this article, we proposed an approach to assessing the condition of patients with PD using deep recurrent neural networks, trained on data measured using mobile phones. The data was received in two modes: background (data from the phone&rsquo;s sensors) and interactive (data directly entered by the user). For the classification of the patient&rsquo;s condition, we built various models of the neural network. Testing of these models showed that the most efficient was a recurrent network with two layers. The results of the experiment show that with a sufficient amount of the training sample, it is possible to build a neural network that determines the condition of the patient according to the data from the mobile phone sensors with a high probability.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Activities of Daily Living,Smartphone,,,,diagnostics10040214,Article,
Entropy of Real-World Gait in Parkinson's Disease Determined from Wearable Sensors as a Digital Marker of Altered Ambulatory Behavior,"Coates, Lucy; Shi, Jian; Rochester, Lynn; Del Din, Silvia; Pantall, Annette",2020,Sensors,wearable technology; gait; Parkinson's disease; sample entropy; variability; real-world,"Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease. Gait impairment is frequent in the later stages of PD contributing to reduced mobility and quality of life. Digital biomarkers such as gait velocity and step length are predictors of motor and cognitive decline in PD. Additional gait parameters may describe different aspects of gait and motor control in PD. Sample entropy (SampEnt), a measure of signal predictability, is a nonlinear approach that quantifies regularity of a signal. This study investigated SampEnt as a potential biomarker for PD and disease duration. Real-world gait data over a seven-day period were collected using an accelerometer (Axivity AX3, York, UK) placed on the low back and gait metrics extracted. SampEnt was determined for the stride time, with vector length and threshold parameters optimized. People with PD had higher stride time SampEnt compared to older adults, indicating reduced gait regularity. The range of SampEnt increased over 36 months for the PD group, although the mean value did not change. SampEnt was associated with dopaminergic medication dose but not with clinical motor scores. In conclusion, this pilot study indicates that SampEnt from real-world data may be a useful parameter reflecting clinical status although further research is needed involving larger populations.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,"Gait,Limb movements",Wearable,,,,s20092631,Article,

Early Detection of Freezing of Gait during Walking Using Inertial Measurement Unit and Plantar Pressure Distribution Data,"Pardoel, Scott; Shalin, Gaurav; Nantel, Julie; Lemaire, Edward; Kofman, Jonathan",2021,Sensors,Parkinson's disease; freezing of gait; wearable sensors; detection; prediction; machine learning,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a sudden and highly disruptive gait dysfunction that appears in mid to late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) and can lead to falling and injury. A system that predicts freezing before it occurs or detects freezing immediately after onset would generate an opportunity for FOG prevention or mitigation and thus enhance safe mobility and quality of life. This research used accelerometer, gyroscope, and plantar pressure sensors to extract 861 features from walking data collected from 11 people with FOG. Minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance and Relief-F feature selection were performed prior to training boosted ensembles of decision trees. The binary classification models identified Total-FOG or No FOG states, wherein the Total-FOG class included data windows from 2 s before the FOG onset until the end of the FOG episode. Three feature sets were compared: plantar pressure, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and both plantar pressure and IMU features. The plantar-pressure-only model had the greatest sensitivity and the IMU-only model had the greatest specificity. The best overall model used the combination of plantar pressure and IMU features, achieving 76.4% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity. Next, the Total-FOG class components were evaluated individually (i.e., Pre-FOG windows, Freeze windows, transition windows between Pre-FOG and Freeze). The best model detected windows that contained both Pre-FOG and FOG data with 85.2% sensitivity, which is equivalent to detecting FOG less than 1 s after the freeze began. Windows of FOG data were detected with 93.4% sensitivity. The IMU and plantar pressure feature-based model slightly outperformed models that used data from a single sensor type. The model achieved early detection by identifying the transition from Pre-FOG to FOG while maintaining excellent FOG detection performance (93.4% sensitivity). Therefore, if used as part of an intelligent, real-time FOG identification and cueing system, even if the Pre-FOG state were missed, the model would perform well as a freeze detection and cueing system that could improve the mobility and independence of people with PD during their daily activities.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Freezing of gait,Wearable,,,,s21062246,Article,
Towards Human Motion Tracking Enhanced by Semi-Continuous Ultrasonic Time-of-Flight Measurements,"Jahren, Silje; Aakvaag, Niels; Strisland, Frode; Vogl, Andreas; Liberale, Alessandro; Liverud, Anders",2021,Sensors,human motion tracking; gait analysis; inertial measurement units; body sensor network; ultrasonic time of flight,"Human motion analysis is a valuable tool for assessing disease progression in persons with conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Human motion tracking is also used extensively for sporting technique and performance analysis as well as for work life ergonomics evaluations. Wearable inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes and/or magnetometers) are frequently employed because they are easy to mount and can be used in real life, out-of-the-lab-settings, as opposed to video-based lab setups. These distributed sensors cannot, however, measure relative distances between sensors, and are also cumbersome when it comes to calibration and drift compensation. In this study, we tested an ultrasonic time-of-flight sensor for measuring relative limb-to-limb distance, and we developed a combined inertial sensor and ultrasonic time-of-flight wearable measurement system. The aim was to investigate if ultrasonic time-of-flight sensors can supplement inertial sensor-based motion tracking by providing relative distances between inertial sensor modules. We found that the ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements reflected expected walking motion patterns. The stride length estimates derived from ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements corresponded well with estimates from validated inertial sensors, indicating that the inclusion of ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements could be a feasible approach for improving inertial sensor-only systems. Our prototype was able to measure both inertial and time-of-flight measurements simultaneously and continuously, but more work is necessary to merge the complementary approaches to provide more accurate and more detailed human motion tracking.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait analysis,Wearable,,,,s21072259,Article,

Parameters from inertial measurement units (IMUs) are objective and accurate, and thus an interesting option to be included in the regular assessment of these patients. In this study, 68 patients with PD (PwP) in Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) stages 1-4 were assessed with two gait tasks-20 m straight walk and circular walk-using IMUs. In an ANCOVA model, we found a significant and large effect of the H&amp;Y scores on step length in both tasks, and only a minor effect on step time. This study provides evidence that from the two potentially most important gait parameters currently accessible with wearable technology under supervised assessment strategies, step length changes substantially over the course of PD, while step time shows surprisingly little change in the progression of PD. These results show the importance of carefully evaluating quantitative gait parameters to make assumptions about disease progression, and the potential of the granular evaluation of symptoms such as gait deficits when monitoring chronic progressive diseases such as PD.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait analysis,Wearable,,,,s21072292,Brief Report,
Beneficial Effect of Foot Plantar Stimulation in Gait Parameters in Individuals with Parkinson's Disease,"Brognara, Lorenzo; Navarro-Flores, Emmanuel; Iachemet, Lorenzo; Serra-CatalÃƒÂ¡, Nuria; Cauli, Omar",2020,Brain Sciences,asymmetry; stride length; foot; rehabilitation; medical device; 3D printing; additive manufacturing,"New treatments based on peripheral stimulation of the sensory-motor system have shown to be promising in rehabilitation strategies for patients with neurological disorders, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), especially in regards to reducing gait impairment, and hence, the incidence of falls. The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in several gait parameters measured by sensor inertial measurement in PD patients after acute plantar stimulation, under the distal phalanx of the big toe, and underneath the head of the first metatarsal joint of both feet, using a 3D printing insole. In order to assess whether the effects are selective for PD patients, we compared the effect of the treatment in a control group (age-matched) consisting of patients with other neurological disorders which also displayed gait and balance impairment, and a similar cognitive function, depressive symptoms, body mass index, and comorbidity burden observed in the PD group. Plantar foot stimulation in PD patients eliminated the significant (p &lt; 0.05) alterations existing in stride asymmetry and in stride variability. When comparing the effects of post-plantar stimulation with the respective basal level, considered as 100% in both groups, we observed a significant (p = 0.019, Mann&ndash;Whitney test) increase in stride length compared to basal in the PD group and control group. No significant effects of foot plantar stimulation were observed in any of the gait parameters in the control group. Plantar foot stimulation has a positive effect on the step and stride length, and has a positive effect on walking stability, measured by the increase in stride length. No significant effect was observed on bradykinesia because it did not improve walking velocity. These findings indicate that foot plantar stimulation using a 3D printing insole seems to generate a more stable walking pattern in PD patients, with an interesting applicability, and a low-cost, for reducing gait impairment in PD patients.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait analysis,Wearable,,,,brainsci10020069,Article,
High-Specificity Digital Architecture for Real-Time Recognition of Loss of Balance Inducing Fall,"De Venuto, Daniela; Mezzina, Giovanni",2020,Sensors,near falls; loss of balance; pre-impact fall detection; activities of daily life; bio-signals; EEG; EMG,"Falls are a significant cause of loss of independence, disability and reduced quality of life in people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). Intervening quickly and accurately on the postural instability could strongly reduce the consequences of falls. In this context, the paper proposes and validates a novel architecture for the reliable recognition of losses of balance situations. The proposed system addresses some challenges related to the daily life applicability of near-fall recognition systems: the high specificity and system robustness against the Activities of Daily Life (ADL). In this respect, the proposed algorithm has been tested on five different tasks: walking steps, sudden curves, chair transfers via the timed up and go (TUG) test, balance-challenging obstacle avoidance and slip-induced loss of balance. The system analyzes data from wireless acquisition devices that capture electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals. The collected data are sent to two main units: the muscular unit and the cortical one. The first realizes a binary ON/OFF pattern from muscular activity (10 EMGs) and triggers the cortical unit. This latter unit evaluates the rate of variation in the EEG power spectrum density (PSD), considering five bands of interest. The neuromuscular features are then sent to a logical network for the final classification, which distinguishes among falls and ADL. In this preliminary study, we tested the proposed model on 9 healthy subjects (aged 26.3 &plusmn; 2.4 years), even if the study on PD patients is under investigation.

In this work, we developed a computationally-efficient algorithm (SDI-Step) that uses segmented double integration to calculate step length and step time from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and assessed its ability to reliably and accurately measure spatiotemporal gait parameters. Two data sets that included simultaneous measurements from wearable sensors and from a laboratory-based system were used in the assessment. The first data set utilized IMU sensors and a GAITRite mat in our laboratory to monitor gait in fifteen participants: 9 young adults (YA1) (5 females, 4 males, age 23.6 &plusmn; 1 years), and 6 people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) (3 females, 3 males, age 72.3 &plusmn; 6.6 years). The second data set, which was accessed from a publicly-available repository, utilized IMU sensors and an optoelectronic system to monitor gait in five young adults (YA2) (2 females, 3 males, age 30.5 &plusmn; 3.5 years). In order to provide a complete representation of validity, we used multiple statistical analyses with overlapping metrics. Gait parameters such as step time and step length were calculated and the agreement between the two measurement systems for each gait parameter was assessed using Passing&ndash;Bablok (PB) regression analysis and calculation of the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC (2,1)) with 95% confidence intervals for a single measure, absolute-agreement, 2-way mixed-effects model. In addition, Bland&ndash;Altman (BA) plots were used to visually inspect the measurement agreement. The values of the PB regression slope were close to 1 and intercept close to 0 for both step time and step length measures. The results obtained using ICC (2,1) for step length showed a moderate to excellent agreement for YA (between 0.81 and 0.95) and excellent agreement for PD (between 0.93 and 0.98), while both YA and PD had an excellent agreement in step time ICCs (&gt;0.9). Finally, examining the BA plots showed that the measurement difference was within the limits of agreement (LoA) with a 95% probability. Results from this preliminary study indicate that using the SDI-Step algorithm to process signals from wearable IMUs provides measurements that are in close agreement with widely-used laboratory-based systems and can be considered as a valid tool for measuring spatiotemporal gait parameters.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Gait analysis,Wearable,,,,s20226417,Article,

However, despite several recent efforts, most algorithms for detecting STS transfers rely on multiple sensing modalities or device locations and have predominantly been used for assessment during the performance of prescribed tasks in a lab setting. A novel wavelet-based algorithm for detecting STS transfers from data recorded using an accelerometer on the lower back is presented herein. The proposed algorithm is independent of device orientation and was validated on data captured in the lab from younger and older healthy adults as well as in people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PwPD). The algorithm was then used for processing data captured in free-living conditions to assess the ability of multiple features extracted from STS transfers to detect age-related group differences and assess the impact of monitoring duration on the reliability of measurements. The results show that performance of the proposed algorithm was comparable or significantly better than that of a commercially available system (precision: 0.990 vs. 0.868 in healthy adults) and a previously published algorithm (precision: 0.988 vs. 0.643 in persons with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease). Moreover, features extracted from STS transfers at home were able to detect age-related group differences at a higher level of significance compared to data captured in the lab during the performance of prescribed tasks. Finally, simulation results showed that a monitoring duration of 3 days was sufficient to achieve good reliability for measurement of STS features. These results point towards the feasibility of using a single accelerometer on the lower back for detection and assessment of STS transfers during daily life. Future work in different patient populations is needed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, as well as assess the sensitivity and reliability of the STS features.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Activities of Daily Living,Wearable,,,,s20226618,Article,
Sensor-Based and Patient-Based Assessment of Daily-Living Physical Activity in People with Parkinson's Disease: Do Motor Subtypes Play a Role?,"Galperin, Irina; Herman, Talia; Assad, Mira; Ganz, Natalie; Mirelman, Anat; Giladi, Nir; Hausdorff, Jeffrey",2020,Sensors,wearables; accelerometer; physical activity; Parkinson's disease; motor subtypes,"The benefits of daily-living physical activity are clear. Nonetheless, the relationship between physical activity levels and motor subtypes of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), i.e., tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD), have not been well-studied. It is also unclear if patient perspectives and motor symptom severity are related to objective, sensor-based assessment of daily-living activity in those subtypes. To address these questions, total daily-living physical activity was quantified in 73 patients with PD and 29 healthy controls using a 3D-accelerometer worn on the lower back for at least three days. We found that individuals with the PIGD subtype were significantly less active than healthy older adults (p = 0.007), unlike individuals with the TD subtype. Among the PIGD subtype, higher daily physical activity was negatively associated with more severe ON bradykinesia (rS = -0.499, p = 0.002), motor symptoms (higher ON MDS-UPDRS (Unified Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale motor examination)-III scores), gait difficulties (rS = -0.502, p = 0.002), motor complications (rS = 0.466, p = 0.004), and balance (rS = 0.519, p = 0.001). In contrast, among the TD subtype, disease-related characteristics were not related to daily-living physical activity. Intriguingly, physical activity was not related to self-report of ADL difficulties (scores of the MDS-UPDRS Parts I or II) in both motor subtypes. These findings highlight the importance of objective daily-living physical activity monitoring and suggest that self-report does not necessarily reflect objective physical activity levels. Furthermore, the results point to important differences in factors related to physical activity in PD motor subtypes, setting the stage for personalized treatment programs.",,,Prognosis/Monitoring Disease Progression,Activities of Daily Living,Wearable,,,,s20247015,Article,

ReadySteady intervention to promote physical activity in older adults with Parkinson's disease: Study design and methods,"Krishnamurthi N,Fleury J,Belyea M,Shill HA,Abbas JJ",2020,Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications,"Parkinson's disease, Wellness motivation, Polestriding, Physical activity","The main motor impairments of gait and balance experienced by people with Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in poor physical conditioning, loss of functional independence, and reduced quality of life. Despite the known benefits of physical activity in PD, the majority of older adults with PD are insufficiently active. Few studies incorporate behavioral change approaches to promoting physical activity in PD. The main goal of this research is to foster community mobility in older adults with PD by promoting physical activity and improving gait patterns using a theory-based behavioral change intervention. The ReadySteady intervention combines wellness motivation theory with polestriding physical activity, which has been shown to be beneficial for people with PD. The intervention will be tested using a randomized controlled design, including inactive older adults diagnosed with PD. Participants will be randomly assigned the 12-week ReadySteady intervention, 12-week polestriding, and education intervention, or 12-week education intervention. Thirty-six older adults with PD will participate in each of the interventions. Level of physical activity, clinical scores, quantitative measures of gait and balance control, and motivational variables for each intervention will be measured at three time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention (12 weeks), and follow-up (24 weeks). If the intervention is beneficial, it may serve as a sustainable addition to current practice in health promotion efforts serving the PD population.",>30,Home,Rehabilitation,"Activities of Daily Living,gait",Wearable,,IMU,,j.conctc.2019.100513,Journal Article,

Design Single-blind randomized controlled trial. Setting University laboratory and a rehabilitation gym at a health center. Participants Patients (N=40) with a diagnosis of Parkinson disease (mean age, 66.72y; age range, 44-79y) with Hoehn and Yahr stage I to III who were on medication were randomized to either a group with dual-task training or a group with single-task training (only gait). Intervention Both interventions involved 20 sessions lasting 1 hour each and conducted twice a week. Dual-task training included walking exercises and cognitive or motor tasks carried out separately, then later performed together as a dual-task according to a progressive protocol in the same training session. Main Outcome Measures Velocity and spatiotemporal parameters of gait were measured without a secondary task and during dual-task gait combined with a visual, verbal, auditory, and motor task. In addition, executive cognitive function and quality of life were measured. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postrehabilitation, and at the 8-week follow-up. Results The dual-task group demonstrated improved velocity and stride length time in all assessment conditions after training (P.05). Likewise, the dual-task group showed higher velocity and stride length after treatment than the single-task group across conditions. No significant changes were observed in cognitive performance (P>.05), although the dual-task group tended to improve performance during the executive function test. Conclusions Dual-task training in functional contexts is associated with greater improvements in velocity and stride length in patients with PD compared with regular physiotherapy without secondary tasks.

Cueing triggered upon real-time FOG detection (on-demand cueing) shows promise for FOG treatment. Yet, the feasibility of implementation and efficacy in daily life is still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of DeFOG: a smartphone and sensor-based on-demand cueing solution for FOG. Methods Sixty-two PD patients with FOG will be recruited for this single-blind, multi-center, randomized controlled phase II trial. Patients will be randomized into either the intervention group or the active control group. For four weeks, both groups will receive feedback about their physical activity using the wearable DeFOG system in daily life. In addition, the intervention group will also receive on-demand auditory cueing and instructions. Before and after the intervention, home-based assessments will be performed to evaluate the primary outcome, i.e.,""percentage time frozen""Ã‚Â during a FOG-provoking protocol. Secondary outcomes include the training effects on physical activity monitored over 7 days and the user-friendliness of the technology. Discussion The DeFOG trial will investigate the effectiveness of personalized on-demand cueing in a controlled design, delivered for 4 weeks in the patient's home environment. We anticipate that DeFOG will reduce FOG to a greater degree than in the control group and we will explore the impact of the intervention on physical activity levels. We expect to gain in-depth insight into whether and how patients control FOG using cueing methods in their daily lives.

This study aimed to investigate the applicability and tolerability of sensory and motor electrical stimulation in 10 people with Parkinson's disease. The study focused on assessing the electrical stimulation voltages and visual analogue scale discomfort scores at the electrical sensory, motor, discomfort, and pain thresholds. Results show that sensory electrical stimulation at the tibialis anterior, soleus, hamstrings, and quadriceps stimulation sites was applicable and tolerable for 6/10, 10/10, 9/10, and 10/10 participants, respectively. Furthermore, motor electrical stimulation at the tibialis anterior, soleus, hamstrings, and quadriceps stimulation sites were applicable and tolerable for 7/10, 7/10, 7/10, and 8/10 participants, respectively. Interestingly, the thresholds for the lower leg were higher than those of the upper leg. The data presented in this paper indicate that sensory and motor electrical stimulation is applicable and tolerable for cueing applications in people with Parkinson's disease. Sensory electrical stimulation was applicable and tolerable at the soleus and quadriceps sites. Motor electrical stimulation was not tolerable for two participants at any of the proposed stimulation sites.

Treadmill walking alters stride time dynamics in Parkinson's disease,"Hollman JH,Von Arb HM,Budreck AM,Muehlemann A,Ness DK",2020,Gait & Posture,"Parkinson disease, Gait, Walking speed, Fractals","Background Treadmill training may be used to improve gait rhythmicity in people with Parkinson's disease. Treadmills, however, alter dynamical stride time fluctuations in healthy adults in a manner that mimics pathologic states, indicating the stride-to-stride fluctuations that characterize healthy gait are constrained. It is unclear if treadmills similarly alter dynamic gait properties in Parkinson's disease. Research question Do stride time fractal dynamics in individuals with Parkinson's disease differ between treadmill and overground walking? Methods Fifteen participants with Parkinson's disease and 15 healthy age-similar adults walked for 6 min in a conventional overground condition and on a treadmill while wearing inertial measurement units. Gait speed, stride times and stride time variability were measured. Fractal exponents (ÃƒÂŽÃ‚Â±) were computed with adaptive fractal analysis. Inferential statistics were analyzed with mixed model analyses of variance and post hoc simple effects tests. Results Mean gait speeds decreased and stride times increased on the treadmill but did not differ between the Parkinson's and control groups. Stride time variability was greater in the Parkinson's than control group in both conditions. Most relevant to our research question, stride time fractal exponents were greater on the treadmill (mean ÃƒÂŽÃ‚Â± = .910) than overground (mean ÃƒÂŽÃ‚Â± = .797) in individuals with Parkinson's disease, but not in healthy controls. Significance The fractal scaling exponent ÃƒÂŽÃ‚Â± emanating from stride time fluctuations during treadmill walking increased toward a 1/f signal of ÃƒÂŽÃ‚Â± = 1.0 that has been interpreted as an optimal structural variability for gait. The clinical implication is that treadmill training may promote more efficient walking dynamics in people with Parkinson's disease than conventional overground training.",10<n<=20,Laboratory,Rehabilitation,Gait,Wearable,,Accelerometer,128Hz,j.gaitpost.2020.02.005,Journal Article,

Design Single group, observational, before-after trial. Setting Table tennis training in a gymnasium. Participants Community-dwelling individuals with Parkinson disease (N=9; 5 men, 4 women) with an average age of 66.9 years, average time since diagnosis of 8.6 years, and a modified Hoehn and Yahr score between 2 and 2.5 participated in this study. Participants were recruited via newspaper advertisement, at the patient organization, and at the university hospital outpatient clinic. Eight participants completed the study. One participant withdrew for logistical reasons. Interventions Group training program consisting of 2 table tennis training sessions per week (120min each) for 10 weeks. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was feasibility, including attendance rate, drop-out rate, a final questionnaire assessing the participants' experience during the intervention, and any adverse events. The primary effect outcome was the Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest). Secondary effect outcomes were Parkinson's disease questionnaire-8, European quality of life questionnaire, Montgomery ÃƒÂƒÃ¢Â€Â¦sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, 10-meter walk test, generic walking scale, activities-specific balance confidence scale, and physical activity measured with an accelerometer and the FrÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¤ndin-Grimby scale.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of music-based physical therapy on the international Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) components: disability, cognition, muscle strength, balance, and functional mobility. Methods This was a controlled, non-randomized clinical trial involving 13 individuals with PD assessed at three times: baseline, period 1 (treatment), and period 2 (no treatment). The variables analyzed were: disability by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y), cognitive function by Trail Making Test, muscle strength by Medical Research Council (MRC) and sitting-rising (SR) test, balance and functional mobility by Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed up and Go (TUG). ANOVA with post-hoc multiple comparison was used to determine statistical differences between the baseline, period 1 and 2. Results there was statistically significant difference among the period 1 and 2 for the cognitive function; there was a statistically significant difference between the period 1 and 2 in SR test; in the balance evaluation by BBS, an increase was observed between the baseline and the period 1, followed by a decrease in period 2; in the TUG, there was an increase between the period 1 and 2.

Therefore, a validation study may lead to the feasibility of devices to stimulate an increase in the number of steps and physical activity level of individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Aim To investigate the validity of mHealth devices to estimate the number of steps in individuals with PD and compare the estimate with a standard criterion measure. Method An observational study in a university laboratory with 34 individuals with idiopathic PD. The number of steps was measured using mHealth devices (Google Fit, Health, STEPZ, Pacer, and Fitbit INCÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â®), and compared against a criterionstandard measure during the Two-Minute Walk Test using habitual speed. Results Our sample was 82% men with a Hoehn and Yahr mean of 2.3 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 1.3 and mean walking speed of 1.2 ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â± 0.2 m/s.

Hypoactivation of cortical neurons in supplementary motor area (SMA) has been linked to the progression of bradykinesia symptoms. This study investigated the influence of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over SMA on upper limb movement for individuals diagnosed with PD. Methods Thirteen individuals with PD performed a simple reaction time (RT) task involving elbow extension following an auditory go-signal. Sham or anodal tDCS was then applied over SMA for 10 minutes before participants repeated the simple RT task. Participants were unaware of which stimulation they received in each testing session. Electromyography (EMG) and kinematic data were recorded on all trials. Results While there were no significant differences in premotor RT, anodal tDCS applied over SMA led to significantly shorter time to peak displacement (p = .015) and movement time (p = .003) compared to pre-tDCS trials, whereas sham stimulation had no impact on these variables. Conclusions These results provide evidence that anodal tDCS applied over SMA contributes to improvements in movement kinematics of an upper limb simple RT task.

Methods Using a video motion system, we recorded gait in 174 patients with PD. The patients' clinical characteristics (including motor status, cognitive status, disease duration, dopaminergic treatment and any history of falls or freezing of gait) were noted. The considered kinematic gait parameters included indices of gait bradykinesia and hypokinesia, asymmetry, variability, and foot clearance. After a parameters selection using an ANCOVA analysis, support vector machine algorithm was used to build classification models for distinguishing between fallers and non-fallers. Two models were built, the first included clinical data only while the second incorporated the selected gait parameters. Results The""clinical-only""Ã‚Â model had an accuracy of 94% for distinguishing between fallers and non-fallers. The model incorporating additional gait parameters including stride time and foot clearance performed even better, with an accuracy of up to 97%.

Fall risk makes the neural control of maximal speed ambulatory movements difficult to study in Parkinson's. Stationary recumbent bicycling favors the use of electromyography at high movement speeds, and may better reveal neuromuscular rate limiters. Methods Subjects were 18 adults with Parkinson's, 14 older adults and 14 young adults. Electromyograms were recorded from two muscles during stationary recumbent bicycling at 60, 80, 100, 120 RPM and peak voluntary cadence. Rate of electromyogram rise was calculated. Subjects performed the timed up and go and four square step test. Parkinson's sub-groups were formed based on whether they could pedal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â€Â°Ã‚Â¥120 RPM. Mixed models were used to compare groups and spearman's correlations quantified relationships. Findings Eight people with Parkinson's and four older adults could not complete the 120 RPM condition. Faster people with Parkinson's (n = 10) had greater maximum cadence (F = 42.85, P 16.9, P 6.5, P < 0.05) than slower people with Parkinson's (n = 8). In Parkinson's, correlations between vastus lateralis rate of electromyogram rise and four square step test (ÃƒÂÃ‚Â = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™0.62), timed up and go (ÃƒÂÃ‚Â = ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Â†Ã¢Â€Â™0.53), and peak cadence (ÃƒÂÃ‚Â = 0.76) were significant (all P < 0.05).

Methods This manuscript introduces a new gait monitoring system adapted to patients with PD, based on a wearable monitoring device. To eliminate inter- and intra-subject variability, the computational method was based on heuristic rules with adaptive thresholds and ranges and a motion compensation strategy. The experimental trials involved repeated measurements of walking trials from two cross-sectional studies: the first study was performed in order to validate the effectiveness of the system against a robust 3D motion analysis with 10 healthy subjects; and the second-one aimed to validate our approach against a well-studied wearable IMU-based system on a hospital environment with 20 patients with PD. Results The proposed system proved to be efficient (Experiment I: sensitivity = 95,09% and accuracy = 93,64%; Experiment II: sensitivity = 99,53% and accuracy = 97,42%), time-effective (Experiment I: earlies = 13,71 ms and delays = 12,91 ms; Experiment II: earlies = 12,94 ms and delays = 12,71 ms), user and user-motion adaptable and a low computational-load strategy for real-time gait events detection.

Additionally, the efficacy of this gamified DTT was compared to physical single-task training (STT), both of which were optimized using physio-motivational factors, on changes in motor and cognitive outcomes, and self-assessed disability in activities of daily living. Methods: Using a cross-over study design, eight participants with mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD (including one with mild cognitive impairment) completed both training conditions (i.e., gamified DTT and STT). For each training condition, the participants attended 2â€“3 sessions per week over 8.8 weeks on average, with the total amount of training being equivalent to 24 1 h sessions. A washout period averaging 11.5 weeks was inserted between training conditions. STT consisted of task-oriented training involving the practice of functional tasks, whereas for gamified DTT, the same task-oriented training was implemented simultaneously with varied cognitive games using an interactive training system (SMARTfit Â® ). Both training conditions were optimized through continual adaptation to ensure the use of challenging tasks and to provide autonomy support. Training hours, heart rate, and adverse events were measured to assess the feasibility and safety of the gamified DTT protocol. Motor and cognitive function as well as perceived disability were assessed before and after each training condition. Results: Gamified DTT was feasible and safe for this cohort. Across participants, significant improvements were achieved in more outcome measures after gamified DTT than they were after STT. Individually, participants with specific demographic and clinical characteristics responded differently to the two training conditions. Conclusion: Physical therapistsâ€™ utilization of technology with versatile hardware configurations and customizable software application selections was feasible and safe for implementing a tailor-made intervention and for adapting it in real-time to meet the individualized, evolving training needs of IWPD. Specifically in comparison to optimized STT, there was a preliminary signal of efficacy for gamified DTT in improving motor and cognitive function as well as perceived disability in IWPD.",,,Rehabilitation,"Motion,Activities of Daily Living",Other,,Smart trainer,,ijerph182312384,research-article,

By using the technology of a mobile phone, acceleration of arm swing can be converted into a closedâ€loop musical feedback (musification) to improve gait. To assess arm swing in healthy subjects and the effects of musification on arm swing amplitude and other gait parameters in patients with PD. Gait kinematics were analyzed in 30 patients during a 320â€‰m walk in 3 different conditions comprising (1) normal walking; (2) focused swinging of the more affected arm; and (3) with musification of arm swing provided by the iPhone application CuraSwing. The acceleration of arm swing was converted into musical feedback. Arm swing range of motion and further gait kinematics were analyzed. In addition, arm swing in patients was compared to 32 healthy subjects walking at normal, slow, and fast speeds. Musification led to a large and bilateral increase of arm swing range of motion in patients. The increase was greater on the more affected side of the patient (+529.5% compared to baseline). In addition, symmetry of arm swing, sternum rotation, and stride length increased. With musical feedback patients with PD reached arm swing movements within or above the range of healthy subjects. Musification has an immediate effect on arm swing and other gait kinematics in PD. The results suggest that closedâ€loop musical feedback is an effective technique to improve walking in patients with PD.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait parameters,Smartphone,,"IMU, audio cueing",,mdc3.13352,research-article,
The Effect of Reminiscence Therapy Using Virtual Reality on Apathy in Residential Aged Care: Multisite Nonrandomized Controlled Trial,,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"reminiscence,head-mounted display,apathy,cognitive aging,dementia,residential facilities,virtual reality","Apathy is a frequent and underrecognized neurological disorder symptom. Reduced goal-directed behavior caused by apathy is associated with poor outcomes for older adults in residential aged care. Recommended nonpharmacological treatments include person-centered therapy using information and communication technology. Virtual reality (VR) in the form of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is a fully immersive technology that provides access to a wide range of freely available content. The use of VR as a therapy tool has demonstrated promise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety. In addition, VR has been used to improve conditions including depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and balance in older adults with memory deficits, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. Research using VR for the symptoms of apathy in older adults living in residential aged care facilities is limited. This study aims to examine whether using HMDs as a tool for reminiscence therapy improves the symptoms of apathy compared with using a laptop computer and physical items with older adults living in residential aged care. In this multisite trial, 43 participants were allocated to one of three groups: reminiscence therapy intervention using VR in the form of HMDs, reminiscence therapy using a laptop computer supplemented by physical items if required (active control), and a usual care (passive control) group. The primary outcome was apathy, and the secondary outcomes included cognition and depression. The side effects of using HMDs were also measured in the VR group. Mixed model analyses revealed no significant group interaction over time in outcomes between the VR and laptop groups (estimate=âˆ’2.24, SE 1.89; t 40 =âˆ’1.18; P= .24). Pooled apathy scores in the two intervention groups compared with the passive control group also revealed no significant group interaction over time (estimate=âˆ’0.26, SE 1.66; t 40 =âˆ’0.16; P= .88). There were no significant secondary outcomes. Most participants in the VR group stated that they would prefer to watch content in VR than on a flat screen ( Î§ 2 2 =11.2; P =.004), side effects from HMD use were negligible to minimal according to the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire cutoff scores. Although there were no significant results in outcome measures, this study found that participants engaged in the research and enjoyed the process of reminiscing using both forms of technology. It was found that VR can be implemented in an aged care setting with correct protocols in place. Providing residents in aged care with a choice of technology may assist in increasing participation in activities. We cannot dismiss the importance of immediate effects while the therapy was in progress, and this is an avenue for future research.

The brain functional underpinnings of proactive inhibition, and notably the role of basal ganglia, are not entirely identified. We investigated the effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus on proactive inhibition in patients with Parkinson's disease. They completed a cued go/noâ€go proactive inhibition task ON and (unilateral) OFF stimulation while EEG was recorded. We found no behavioural effect of either subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus deep brain stimulation on proactive inhibition, despite a general improvement of motor performance with subthalamic nucleus stimulation. In the nonâ€operated and subthalamic nucleus group, we identified periods of topographic EEG modulation by the level of proactive inhibition. In the subthalamic nucleus group, source estimation analysis suggested the initial involvement of bilateral frontal and occipital areas, followed by a right lateralized frontoâ€basal network, and finally of right premotor and left parietal regions. Our results confirm the overall preservation of proactive inhibition capacities in both subthalamic nucleus and internal globus pallidus deep brain stimulation, and suggest a partly segregated network for proactive inhibition, with a preferential recruitment of the indirect pathway.",,,Rehabilitation,,Deep Brain Stimulation,,,,hbm.25530,research-article,

Treating Parkinsonâ€™s disease with freezing of gait is very difficult, while the use of medicine and operation has been ineffective. Music exercise therapy, which entails listening to music as you exercise, has been proposed as a treatment technology that can change patientsâ€™ behavior, emotions, and physiological activity. In recent years, music exercise therapy has been widely used in treatment of motor disorders and neurological diseases and achieved remarkable results. Results from our earlier pilot study revealed that music exercise therapy can improve the freezing of gait of Parkinsonâ€™s patients and improve their quality of life. Therefore, we aim to validate clinical efficacy of this therapy on freezing of gait of Parkinsonâ€™s patients using a larger sample size. This three-arm randomized controlled trial will evaluate clinical efficacy of music exercise therapy in improving the freezing of gait in Parkinsonâ€™s patients. We will recruit a total of 81 inpatients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, who meet the trial criteria. The patients will randomly receive music exercise with and without music as well as routine rehabilitation therapies, followed by analysis of changes in their gait and limb motor function after 4â€‰weeks of intervention. We will first use a three-dimensional gait analysis system to evaluate changes in patientsâ€™ gait, followed by assessment of their limb function, activity of daily living and fall risk. The findings of this trial are expected to affirm the clinical application of this therapy for future management of the disease. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1900026063 .

This electroencephalography (EEG) study aimed to investigate the effective connectivity patterns characterizing PD in the resting state and during music listening. EEG recordings were obtained from fourteen non-demented PD patients and 12 healthy controls, at rest and while listening to three music tracks. Theta- and alpha-band power spectral density and multivariate partial directed coherence were computed. Power and connectivity measures were compared between patients and controls in the four conditions and in music vs. rest. Compared to controls, patients showed enhanced theta-band power and slightly enhanced alpha-band power, but markedly reduced theta- and alpha-band interactions among EEG channels, especially concerning the information received by the right central channel. EEG power differences were partially reduced by music listening, which induced power increases in controls but not in patients. Connectivity differences were slightly compensated by music, whose effects largely depended on the track. In PD, music enhanced the frontotemporal inter-hemispheric communication. Our findings suggest that PD is characterized by enhanced activity but reduced information flow within the EEG network, being only partially normalized by music. Nevertheless, music capability to facilitate inter-hemispheric communication might underlie its beneficial effects on PD pathophysiology and should be further investigated.",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Cueing,,,,fnagi.2021.657221,research-article,

Yet, patients usually show reduced physical activity compared to healthy older adults. Using auditory stimulation such as music can facilitate walking but patients vary significantly in their response. An individualized approach adapting musical tempo to patientsâ€™ gait cadence, and capitalizing on these individual differences, is likely to provide a rewarding experience, increasing motivation for walk-in PD. We aim to evaluate the observance, safety, tolerance, usability, and enjoyment of a new smartphone application. It was coupled with wearable sensors (BeatWalk) and delivered individualized musical stimulation for gait auto-rehabilitation at home. Forty-five patients with PD underwent a 1-month, outdoor, uncontrolled gait rehabilitation program, using the BeatWalk application (30 min/day, 5 days/week). The music tempo was being aligned in real-time to patientsâ€™ gait cadence in a way that could foster an increase up to +10% of their spontaneous cadence. Open-label evaluation was based on BeatWalk use measures, questionnaires, and a six-minute walk test. Patients used the application 78.8% (Â±28.2) of the prescribed duration and enjoyed it throughout the program. The application was considered â€œeasy to useâ€ by 75% of the patients. Pain, fatigue, and falls did not increase. Fear of falling decreased and quality of life improved. After the program, patients improved their gait parameters in the six-minute walk test without musical stimulation. BeatWalk is an easy to use, safe, and enjoyable musical application for individualized gait rehabilitation in PD. It increases â€œwalk for exerciseâ€ duration thanks to high observance.

We present data from the rapid implementation of virtual visits in a large, academic, Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe the strategic shift to virtual visits and retrospectively examine elements that impacted the ability to switch to telemedicine visits using historical prepandemic in-person data as a comparator, including demographics, distance driven, and diagnosis distribution, with an additional focus on patients with deep brain stimulators. A total of 686 telemedicine visits were performed over a five-week period (60% of those previously scheduled for in-office visits). The average age of participants was 65 years, 45% were female, and 73% were Caucasian. Men were more likely to make the transition ( p = 0.02). Telemedicine patients lived farther from the clinic than those seen in person (66.47 km vs. 42.16 km, p < 0.001), age was not associated with making the switch, and patient satisfaction did not change. There was a significant shift in the distribution of Bradykinesia and Dyskinesia diagnoses seen by telemedicine compared to prepandemic in-person visits ( p < 0.001). Patients with deep brain stimulators were more likely to use telemedicine (11.5% vs. 7%, p < 0.001).

However, continuous stimulation may deliver unnecessary current to the brain due to the intermittent nature of the tremor. We proposed to close the loop of thalamic stimulation by detecting tremorâ€provoking movement states using local field potentials recorded from the same electrodes implanted for stimulation, so that the stimulation is only delivered when necessary. Eight patients with essential tremor participated in this study. Patientâ€specific support vector machine classifiers were first trained using data recorded while the patient performed tremorâ€provoking movements. Then, the trained models were applied in realâ€time to detect these movements and triggered the delivery of stimulation. Using the proposed method, stimulation was switched on for 80.37â€‰Â±â€‰7.06% of the time when tremorâ€evoking movements were present. In comparison, the stimulation was switched on for 12.71â€‰Â±â€‰7.06% of the time when the patients were at rest and tremorâ€free. Compared with continuous stimulation, a similar amount of tremor suppression was achieved while only delivering 36.62â€‰Â±â€‰13.49% of the energy used in continuous stimulation. The results suggest that responsive thalamic stimulation for essential tremor based on tremorâ€provoking movement detection can be achieved without any requirement for external sensors or additional electrocorticography strips. Further research is required to investigate whether the decoding model is stable across time and generalizable to the variety of activities patients may engage with in everyday life.

Levodopa is frequently used in clinical routine to improve nocturnal akinesia, although evidence is not well proven. We assessed associations of Levodopa intake with quality of sleep and perception of nocturnal akinesia in three PD cohorts, using the Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2) in two cohorts and a question on nocturnal immobility in one cohort. In one cohort also objective assessment of mobility during sleep was performed, using mobile health technology. In an independent analysis of all three cohorts (in total n â€‰=â€‰1124 PD patients), patients taking Levodopa CR reported a significantly higher burden by nocturnal akinesia than patients without Levodopa. Higher Levodopa intake and MDS-UPDRS part IV scores (indicating motor fluctuations) predicted worse PDSS-2 and higher subjective nocturnal immobility scores, while disease duration and severity were not predictive. Levodopa intake was not associated with objectively changed mobility during sleep. Our results showed an association of higher Levodopa intake with perception of worse quality of sleep and nocturnal immobility in PD, indicating that Levodopa alone might not be suitable to improve subjective feeling of nocturnal akinesia in PD.

Materials and Methods: Ninety-three patients with Parkinson disease ( n = 29), multiple sclerosis ( n = 26), and stroke ( n = 38) underwent a multidimensional rehabilitation. We focused on changes after treatment on ecological memory (outcome measure) evaluated by Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test, Third Edition (RBMT-3). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) after treatment were calculated for RBMT-3. The change score on RBMT-3 was categorized in positive effect, stabilization, or no effect of the treatment. Random forest classification identified who significantly benefited from treatment against who did not in terms of ecological memory functioning. Accordingly, logistic regression models were created to identify the best predictors of the treatment effect. A predicted probability value was derived, and the profile of the ideal candidate of HEAD protocol was shown by combining different ranks of significant predictors in a 3 Ã— 3 matrix for each pair of predictors. Results: A significant number of cases reported positive effect of the treatment on ecological memory, with an amelioration over the MCID or a stabilization. The random forest analysis highlighted a discrete accuracy of prediction (>0.60) for all the variables considered at baseline for identifying participants who significantly benefited and who did not from the treatment. Significant logistic regression model (Wald method) showed a predictive role of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; p = 0.007), 2 - Minute Walk Test (2MWT; p = 0.038), and RBMT-3 ( p < 0.001) at baseline on HEAD treatment effect. Finally, we observed a high probability of success in people with higher residual cognitive functioning (MoCA; odds ratio = 1.306) or functional mobility (2MWT; odds ratio = 1.013). Discussion: The HEAD program is a rehabilitation with effects on multiple domains, including ecological memory. Residual level of cognitive and/or motor functioning is a significant predictor of the treatment success. These findings confirm the intrinsic relationship subsisting between motor and cognitive functions and suggest the beneficial effects of physical activity on cognitive functions and vice versa .",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Video Recording,,,,fneur.2020.618330,research-article,

The results of the present study indicated a statistically significant difference between the GSH and control groups, in terms of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III [standard mean difference (SMD), -0.48; 95% CI, -(0.88-0.08); P=0.02] and GSH peroxidase (SMD, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.52-3.24; P=0.007). However, the differences in the UPDRS I (SMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.25-0.16; P=0.70) and UPDRS II (SMD, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.17-0.24; P=0.77) score and in side effects were not statistically significant between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed that the dosage (300 vs. 600 mg) was an influencing factor for UPDRS III. The present study demonstrated that GSH may mildly improve motor scores in PD, but not at the expense of increased adverse events.",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Other,,,,etm.2020.9557,research-article,
Pre-Movement Cortico-Muscular Dynamics Underlying Improved Parkinson Gait Initiation after Instructed Arm Swing,"Weersink, Joyce B.; Gefferie, Silvano R.; van Laar, Teus; Maurits, Natasha M.; de Jong, Bauke M.",2020,Journal of Parkinson's Disease,"Arm swing,Parkinsonâ€™s disease,gait initiation,supplementary motor area,ambulant electroencephalography","The supplementary motor area (SMA) is implicated in both motor initiation and stereotypic multi-limb movements such as walking with arm swing. Gait in Parkinsonâ€™s disease exhibits starting difficulties and reduced arm swing, consistent with reduced SMA activity. We tested whether enhanced arm swing could improve Parkinson gait initiation and assessed whether increased SMA activity during preparation might facilitate such improvement. Effects of instructed arm swing on cortical activity, muscle activity and kinematics were assessed by ambulant EEG, EMG, accelerometers and video in 17 Parkinson patients and 19 controls. At baseline, all participants repeatedly started walking after a simple auditory cue. Next, patients started walking at this cue, which now meant starting with enhanced arm swing. EEG changes over the putative SMA and leg motor cortex were assessed by event related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis of recordings at Fz and Cz. Over the putative SMA location (Fz), natural PD gait initiation showed enhanced alpha/theta synchronization around the auditory cue, and reduced alpha/beta desynchronization during gait preparation and movement onset, compared to controls. Leg muscle activity in patients was reduced during preparation and movement onset, while the latter was delayed compared to controls. When starting with enhanced arm swing, these group differences virtually disappeared. Instructed arm swing improves Parkinson gait initiation. ERSP normalization around the cue indicates that the attributed information may serve as a semi-internal cue, recruiting an internalized motor program to overcome initiation difficulties.",10<n<=20,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Wearable,,,,jpd-202112,research-article,

On time follow-up and timely programing of symptoms are important measures to maintain the effectiveness of DBS. Due to the highly contagious nature of 2019-nCoV, patients were quarantined. With the help of Internet technologies, we continued to provide motor and non-motor symptom assessment and remote programming services for postsurgical PD-DBS patients during this extraordinary period. A retrospective analysis was performed on postsurgical PD-DBS patients who could not come to our hospital for programming due to the impact of the 2019-nCoV. The differences between the pre- and post-programming groups were analyzed. We designed a 5-level Likert rating scale to evaluate the effects and convenience of the remote programming and Internet self-evaluation procedures. Of the 36 patients engaged in the remote programming, 32 patients met the inclusion criteria. Four of the 32 patients set initiated stimulation parameters, and the other 28 patients had significant improvement in UPDRS-III. Nearly all the 28 patients were satisfied with the effect of the remote programming. Most of the patients were willing to use remote programming again. Remote programming based on the online evaluation of patientâ€™s symptoms can help improve motor symptoms of postsurgical DBS patients with PD during the quarantine period caused by 2019-nCoV.

Real-Life Gait Performance as a Digital Biomarker for Motor Fluctuations: The Parkinson@Home Validation Study,,2020,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"digital biomarkers,remote patient monitoring,wearable sensors,real-life gait,Parkinson disease,biomarker,patient monitoring,wearables,gait","Wearable sensors have been used successfully to characterize bradykinetic gait in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but most studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled laboratory environments. This paper aims to assess whether sensor-based analysis of real-life gait can be used to objectively and remotely monitor motor fluctuations in PD. The Parkinson@Home validation study provides a new reference data set for the development of digital biomarkers to monitor persons with PD in daily life. Specifically, a group of 25 patients with PD with motor fluctuations and 25 age-matched controls performed unscripted daily activities in and around their homes for at least one hour while being recorded on video. Patients with PD did this twice: once after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication and again 1 hour after medication intake. Participants wore sensors on both wrists and ankles, on the lower back, and in the front pants pocket, capturing movement and contextual data. Gait segments of 25 seconds were extracted from accelerometer signals based on manual video annotations. The power spectral density of each segment and device was estimated using Welchâ€™s method, from which the total power in the 0.5- to 10-Hz band, width of the dominant frequency, and cadence were derived. The ability to discriminate between before and after medication intake and between patients with PD and controls was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out nested cross-validation. From 18 patients with PD (11 men; median age 65 years) and 24 controls (13 men; median age 68 years), â‰¥10 gait segments were available. Using logistic LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, we classified whether the unscripted gait segments occurred before or after medication intake, with mean area under the receiver operator curves (AUCs) varying between 0.70 (ankle of least affected side, 95% CI 0.60-0.81) and 0.82 (ankle of most affected side, 95% CI 0.72-0.92) across sensor locations. Combining all sensor locations did not significantly improve classification (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.93). Of all signal properties, the total power in the 0.5- to 10-Hz band was most responsive to dopaminergic medication. Discriminating between patients with PD and controls was generally more difficult (AUC of all sensor locations combined: 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.90). The video recordings revealed that the positioning of the hands during real-life gait had a substantial impact on the power spectral density of both the wrist and pants pocket sensor. We present a new video-referenced data set that includes unscripted activities in and around the participantsâ€™ homes. Using this data set, we show the feasibility of using sensor-based analysis of real-life gait to monitor motor fluctuations with a single sensor location. Future work may assess the value of contextual sensors to control for real-world confounders.",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Wearable,,,,19068,research-article,

PD studies have shown larger positive effects on motor outcomes than usual treadmill training. However, effects on cognition, in contrast, are less clear. Existing studies provided intensive training protocols and included only stable medicated patients. Thus, a pilot randomized controlled trial was designed to analyze the feasibility of a shorter training protocol as well as preliminary effects on cognition, motor function, and patient-centered outcomes in a rehabilitation setting where PD patients with and without deep brain stimulation (DBS) undergo adaptation of medication and DBS settings. Here, we present the results from the feasibility analysis of the still ongoing trial. Methods: Non-demented PD patients with and without DBS were recruited during their inpatient rehabilitation and randomized to an experimental group (EG; 20 min MATT) or an active control group (CG; 20 min bike ergometer training). The trainings took place for 8 consecutive days and were added to the usual rehabilitation. Feasibility was assessed with the following parameters: patients' study protocol acceptance, study protocol transferability into clinical routine, training-induced adverse events, and patients' training perception. Results: Thirty-two patients (EG: n = 15; CG: n = 17; 72% DBS) were included. The study protocol was well-accepted (inclusion rate: 84%). It was transferable into clinical routines; dropout rates of 40% (EG) and 18% (CG) were observed. However, an in-depth analysis of the dropout cohort did not reveal intervention-related dropout reasons. The MATT and the standard ergometer training showed no adverse events and were positively perceived by PD patients with and without DBS. Conclusion: MATT was shown to be a feasible, safe, and enjoyable treatment option in PD patients with and without DBS. Furthermore, the dropout cohort analysis revealed some exciting first insights into possible dropout reasons that go beyond the form of intervention. Therefore, research would benefit from a common practice of dropout analyses, as this would enhance our understanding of patients' therapy adherence and expectations.",>30,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Cueing,,,,fneur.2020.00790,research-article,

Study findings suggest that individualized non-invasive neuromodulation therapy used repeatedly at home over three months results in safe and effective hand tremor reduction and improves quality of life for many essential tremor patients. Two previous randomized, controlled, single-session trials demonstrated efficacy of non-invasive neuromodulation therapy targeting the median and radial nerves for reducing hand tremor. This current study evaluated efficacy and safety of the therapy over three months of repeated home use. This was a prospective, open-label, post-clearance, single-arm study with 263 patients enrolled across 26 sites. Patients were instructed to use the therapy twice daily for three months. Pre-specified co-primary endpoints were improvements on clinician-rated Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) and patient-rated Bain & Findley Activities of Daily Living (BF-ADL) dominant hand scores. Other endpoints included improvement in the tremor power detected by an accelerometer on the therapeutic device, Clinical and Patient Global Impression scores (CGI-I, PGI-I), and Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST) survey. 205 patients completed the study. The co-primary endpoints were met (pâ‰ª0.0001), with 62% (TETRAS) and 68% (BF-ADL) of â€˜severeâ€™ or â€˜moderateâ€™ patients improving to â€˜mildâ€™ or â€˜slightâ€™.

One factor involved in pain processing is sensory perception of stimuli. With the advent of directional leads, we explore whether directional DBS affects quantitative sensory testing (QST) metrics acutely. PD patients with subthalamic (STN) DBS and directional leads were tested in 5 settings (DBS-OFF, DBS-ON with omnidirectional stimulation, and DBS-ON) for each of three directional segments of contact used for clinical programming. The Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) assessed patientâ€™s motor skills at time of study visit at clinical contact and at contact which produced optimal sensory threshold (defined by the greatest tolerance to mechanical stimuli). Correlation analyses were performed between stimulation parameters [amplitude, frequency, pulse width (PW), total electrical energy delivered (TEED)] and outcome metrics. Sensory thresholds were obtained in nine patients. Directional stimulation did not significantly alter patient perceptions of sensory stimulus [cold pain ( p = 0.69), warm pain ( p = 0.99), Von frey fibers ( p = 0.09), pin-prick ( p = 0.88), vibration ( p = 0.40), pressure ( p = 0.98)]. With correlation analysis, increasing PW at the posterior contact increased pin prick and vibration sensitivity ( p < 0.001). Additionally, an increase in TEED caused a decrease in sensitivity to warm detection when using the anterior ( p = 0.04), lateral ( p = 0.02), and medial contacts ( p = 0.03), and also caused a decrease in sensitivity to cold detection when using the medial contact ( p = 0.03). UPDRS-III remained stable during testing. Motor benefit can be acutely maintained at directional contacts, whereas directional stimulation can modulate thermal and mechanical sensitivity. Further investigation will determine whether these changes are maintained chronically or can be improved with optimized programming.",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Deep Brain Stimulation,,,,fnhum.2020.00217,research-article,
Mobile Health Daily Life Monitoring for Parkinson Disease: Development and Validation of Ecological Momentary Assessments,,2020,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"ecological momentary assessment,experience sampling method,electronic diary,Parkinsonâ€™s disease monitoring","Parkinson disease monitoring is currently transitioning from periodic clinical assessments to continuous daily life monitoring in free-living conditions. Traditional Parkinson disease monitoring methods lack intraday fluctuation detection. Electronic diaries (eDiaries) hold the potential to collect subjective experiences on the severity and burden of motor and nonmotor symptoms in free-living conditions. This study aimed to develop a Parkinson diseaseâ€“specific eDiary based on ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and to explore its validation. An observational cohort of 20 patients with Parkinson disease used the smartphone-based EMA eDiary for 14 consecutive days without adjusting free-living routines. The eDiary app presented an identical questionnaire consisting of questions regarding affect, context, motor and nonmotor symptoms, and motor performance 7 times daily at semirandomized moments. In addition, patients were asked to complete a morning and an evening questionnaire. Mean affect correlated moderate-to-strong and moderate with motor performance (R=0.38 to 0.75; P <.001) and motor symptom (R=0.34 to 0.50; P <.001) items, respectively. The motor performance showed a weak-to-moderate negative correlation with motor symptoms (R=âˆ’0.31 to âˆ’0.48; P <.001). Mean group answers given for on-medication conditions vs wearing-off-medication conditions differed significantly ( P <.05); however, not enough questionnaires were completed for the wearing-off-medication condition to reproduce these findings on individual levels. We presented a Parkinson diseaseâ€“specific EMA eDiary. Correlations between given answers support the internal validity of the eDiary and underline EMAâ€™s potential in free-living Parkinson disease monitoring. Careful patient selection and EMA design adjustment to this targeted population and their fluctuations are necessary to generate robust proof of EMA validation in future work. Combining clinical Parkinson disease knowledge with practical EMA experience is inevitable to design and perform studies, which will lead to the successful integration of eDiaries in free-living Parkinson disease monitoring.",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Smartphone,,,,15628,research-article,

Natural walking activity often declines early in disease progression despite the relative stability of motor impairments. In this study, we propose a paradigm shift with a â€œconnected behavioral approachâ€ that targets real-world walking using cognitive-behavioral training and mobile health (mHealth) technology. The Walking and mHealth to Increase Participation in Parkinson Disease (WHIP-PD) study is a twelve-month, dual site, two-arm, randomized controlled trial recruiting 148 participants with early to mid-stage PD. Participants will be randomly assigned to connected behavioral or active control conditions. Both conditions will include a customized program of goal-oriented walking, walking-enhancing strengthening exercises, and eight in-person visits with a physical therapist. Participants in the connected behavioral condition also will (1) receive cognitive-behavioral training to promote self-efficacy for routine walking behavior and (2) use a mHealth software application to manage their program and communicate remotely with their physical therapist. Active control participants will receive no cognitive-behavioral training and manage their program on paper. Evaluations will occur at baseline, three-, six-, and twelve-months and include walking assessments, self-efficacy questionnaires, and seven days of activity monitoring. Primary outcomes will include the change between baseline and twelve months in overall amount of walking activity (mean number of steps per day) and amount of moderate intensity walking activity (mean number of minutes per day in which >â€‰100 steps were accumulated). Secondary outcomes will include change in walking capacity as measured by the six-minute walk test and ten-meter walk test. We also will examine if self-efficacy mediates change in amount of walking activity and if change in amount of walking activity mediates change in walking capacity. We expect this study to show the connected behavioral approach will be more effective than the active control condition in increasing the amount and intensity of real-world walking activity and improving walking capacity. Determining effective physical activity interventions for persons with PD is important for preserving mobility and essential for maintaining quality of life.

Cues designed to enforce goal-directed turning are not yet available. Objectives: Assess whether augmented reality (AR) visual cues improve FOG and turning in place in PD patients with FOG. Methods: Sixteen PD patients with FOG performed a series of 180Â° turns under an experimental condition with AR visual cues displayed through a HoloLens and two control conditions (one consisting of auditory cues and one without any cues). FOG episodes were annotated by two independent raters from video recordings. Motion data were measured with 17 inertial measurement units for calculating axial kinematics, scaling, and timing of turning. Results: AR visual cues did not reduce the percent time frozen ( p = 0.73) or the number ( p = 0.73) and duration ( p = 0.78) of FOG episodes compared to the control condition without cues. All FOG parameters were higher with AR visual cues than with auditory cues [percent time frozen ( p = 0.01), number ( p = 0.02), and duration ( p = 0.007) of FOG episodes]. The AR visual cues did reduce the peak angular velocity (visual vs. uncued p = 0.03; visual vs. auditory p = 0.02) and step height (visual vs. uncued p = 0.02; visual vs. auditory p = 0.007), and increased the step height coefficient of variation (visual vs. uncued p = 0.04; visual vs. auditory p = 0.01) and time to maximum headâ€“pelvis separation (visual vs. uncued p = 0.02; visual vs. auditory p = 0.005), compared to both control conditions. Conclusions: The AR visual cues in this study did not reduce FOG, and worsened some measures of axial kinematics, and turn scaling and timing. Stimulating goal-directed turning might, by itself, be insufficient to reduce FOG and improve turning performance.

However, quick and objective biomarkers for quantifying the efficacy of DBS intraoperatively are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to study how DBS modulates the intraoperative neuromuscular pattern of resting tremor in PD patients and to find predictive surface electromyography (sEMG) biomarkers for quantifying the intraoperative efficacy of DBS. Methods: Intraoperative sEMG of 39 PD patients with resting tremor was measured with the DBS on and off, respectively, during the intraoperative DBS testing stage. Twelve signal features (time and frequency domains) were extracted from the intraoperative sEMG data. These sEMG features were associated with the clinical outcome to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative DBS. Also, an sEMG-based prediction model was established to predict the clinical improvement rate (IR) of resting tremor with DBS therapy. Results: A typical resting tremor with a peak frequency of 4.93 Â± 0.98 Hz (mean Â± SD) was measured. Compared to the baseline, DBS modulated significant neuromuscular pattern changes in most features except for the peak frequency, by decreasing the motor unit firing rate, amplitude, or power and by changing the regularity pattern. Three sEMG features were detected with significant associations with the clinical improvement rate (IR) of the tremor scale: peak frequency power ( R = 0.37, p = 0.03), weighted root mean square ( R = 0.42, p = 0.01), and modified mean amplitude power ( R = 0.48, p = 0.003). These were adopted to train a Gaussian process regression model with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. The prediction values from the trained sEMG prediction model (1,000 permutations, p = 0.003) showed a good correlation ( r = 0.47, p = 0.0043) with the true IR of the tremor scale. Conclusion: DBS acutely modulated the intraoperative resting tremor, mainly by suppressing the amplitude and motor unit firing rate and by changing the regularity pattern, but not by modifying the frequency pattern. Three features showed strong robustness and could be used as quick intraoperative biomarkers to quantify and predict the efficacy of DBS in PD patients with resting tremor.",,,Rehabilitation,Tremor,Deep Brain Stimulation,,,,fneur.2020.00142,research-article,
Changes in Parkinsonian gait kinematics with self-generated and externally-generated cues: A comparison of responders and non-responders,"Harrison, Elinor C; Horin, Adam P; Myers, Peter S; Rawson, Kerri S; Earhart, Gammon M",2020,Somatosensory & motor research,"Parkinson disease,auditory cues,gait,kinematics","Rhythmic auditory stimulation such as listening to music can alleviate gait bradykinesia in people with Parkinson disease (PD) by increasing spatiotemporal gait features. However, evidence about what specific kinematic alterations lead to these improvements is limited, and differences in responsiveness to cueing likely affect individual motor strategies. Self-generated cueing techniques, such as singing or mental singing, provide similar benefits but no evidence exists about how these techniques affect lower limb joint movement. In this study, we assessed immediate effects of external and self-generated cueing on lower limb movement trajectories during gait. Using 3D motion capture, we assessed sagittal plane joint angles at the hip, knee, and ankle across 35 participants with PD, divided into responders (n=23) and non-responders (n=12) based on a clinically meaningful change in gait speed. Joint motion was assessed as overall range of motion as well as at two key time points during the gait cycle: initial contact and toe-off. Responders used both cue types to increase gait speed and induce increases in overall joint ROM at the hip while only self-generated cues also increased ROM at the ankle. Increased joint excursions for responders were also evident at initial contact and toe off. Our results indicate that self-generated rhythmic cues can induce similar increases in joint excursions as externally-generated cues and that some people may respond more positively than others. These results provide important insight into how self-generated cueing techniques may be tailored to meet the varied individual needs of people with PD.",,,Rehabilitation,Bradykinesia,Cueing,,,,08990220.2020.1713740,research-article,

Findings of this exploratory RCT suggest that yoga may be effective in reducing RLS symptoms and symptom severity, decreasing perceived stress, and improving mood and sleep in adults with RLS.

Multimodal Balance Training Supported by Rhythmical Auditory Stimuli in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Capato, Tamine T.C.; de Vries, Nienke M.; IntHout, Joanna; Barbosa, Egberto R.; Nonnekes, Jorik; Bloem, Bastiaan R.",2019,Journal of Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinsonâ€™s disease,clinical trial,physical therapy,balance,postural control,cueing","Balance impairment in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) improves only partially with dopaminergic medication. Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy are important elements in clinical management. External cues are often applied to improve gait, but their effects on balance control are unclear. We performed a prospective, single-blind, randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of balance training with and without rhythmical auditory cues. We screened 201 volunteers by telephone; 154 were assigned randomly into three groups: (1) multimodal balance training supported by rhythmical auditory stimuli ( n â€Š=â€Š56) (RAS-supported multimodal balance training); (2) regular multimodal balance training without rhythmical auditory stimuli ( n â€Š=â€Š50); and (3) control intervention involving a general education program ( n â€Š=â€Š48). Training was performed for 5 weeks, two times/week. Linear mixed models were used for all outcomes. Primary outcome was the Mini-BESTest (MBEST) score immediately after the training period. Assessments were performed by a single, blinded assessor at baseline, immediately post intervention, and after one and 6-months follow-up. Immediately post intervention, RAS-supported multimodal balance training was more effective than regular multimodal balance training on MBEST (difference 3.5 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.2; 4.8)), p â€Š<â€Š0.001). Patients allocated to both active interventions improved compared to controls (MBEST estimated mean difference versus controls 6.6 (CI 5.2; 8.0), p â€Š<â€Š0.001 for RAS-supported multimodal balance training; and 3.0 (CI 2.7; 5.3), p â€Š<â€Š0.001 for regular multimodal balance training). Improvements were retained at one-month follow-up for both active interventions, but only the RAS-supported multimodal balance training group maintained its improvement at 6 months. Both RAS-supported multimodal balance training and regular multimodal balance training improve balance, but RAS-supported multimodal balance trainingâ€“adding rhythmical auditory cues to regular multimodal balance trainingâ€“has greater and more sustained effects.",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Cueing,,,,jpd-191752,research-article,

Eight patients suffering from the Parkinson's diseases are invited to wear the wearable devices before and after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy to obtain the resting tremor signals. Then, the resting tremor signals are classified into two groups, namely before and after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy. To perform the classification, first the signals are represented in the frequency domain via performing the fast Fourier transforms. Then, the ratios of the energies of the signals in the frequency band 3-8Hz to the whole frequency band are computed. The computer numerical simulation results indicate that the signals obtained from seven out of eight patients can be correctly classified whether they correspond to before or after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy. Through our proposed method, it can be concluded that applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy to the patients suffering from the Parkinson's diseases is effective.",,,Rehabilitation,Tremor,Wearable,,,,csndsp49049.2020.9249509,IEEE Conferences,

Its incidence increases with age. Due to an aging demographic, PD poses an increasing burden on patients and health care resources. PD causes tremors, rigidity, abnormal gait, postural instability, and freezing of gait. These symptoms diminish patients' quality of life. Continuous rehabilitation of PD patients is more effective in the long term than either pharmacotherapy or surgical treatment. Nevertheless, a patient's motivation for rehabilitation suffers from the difficulties associated with the need for frequent visits to a rehabilitation center. The purpose of this study is to develop a serious game based on augmented reality for the rehabilitation of patients with PD. The game was designed to allow patients with PD to ambulate while following virtual visual cues in a real environment as well as incorporated levels with increasing difficulty. We assess improvements in gait and a sense of balance after 3 weeks of training. The results show that all patients have had improvements in these two outcomes.

Inherent to the efficacy of deep brain stimulation is the acquisition of an optimal parameter configuration. Using conventional methods, the optimization process for tuning the deep brain stimulation system parameters can intrinsically induce strain on clinical resources. An advanced means of quantifying Parkinson's hand tremor and distinguishing between parameter settings would be highly beneficial. The conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system, such as the BioStamp nPoint, has a volumetric profile on the order of a bandage that readily enables convenient quantification of Parkinson's disease hand tremor. Furthermore, the BioStamp nPoint has been certified by the FDA as a 510(k) medical device for acquisition of medical grade data. Parametric variation of the amplitude parameter for deep brain stimulation can be quantified through the BioStamp nPoint conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system mounted to the dorsum of the hand. The acquired inertial sensor signal data can be wirelessly transmitted to a secure Cloud computing environment for post-processing. The quantified inertial sensor data for the parametric study of the effects of varying amplitude can be distinguished through machine learning classification. Software automation through Python can consolidate the inertial sensor data into a suitable feature set format. Using the multilayer perceptron neural network considerable machine learning classification accuracy is attained to distinguish multiple parametric settings of amplitude for deep brain stimulation, such as 4.0 mA, 2.5 mA, 1.0 mA, and `Off' status representing a baseline. These findings constitute an advance toward the pathway of attaining real-time closed loop automated parameter configuration tuning for treatment of Parkinson's disease using deep brain stimulation.",,,Rehabilitation,Tremor,Deep Brain Stimulation,,,,embc44109.2020.9175408,IEEE Conferences,
A Close Loop Multi-Area Brain Stimulation Control for Parkinson's Patients Rehabilitation,M. Gheisarnejad; B. Faraji; Z. Esfahani; M. Khooban,2020,IEEE Sensors Journal,Parkinson's disease (PD);deep brain stimulation (DBS);basal ganglia (BG);intelligent single input interval type-2 fuzzy logic (iSIT2-FL),"In recent years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been one of the most effective methods for treating Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias, including hand tremor in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). In order to decrees the Parkinson's tremor, a model of basal ganglia (BG) is often used to design a closed-loop control scheme for DBS. First, a feedback signal is provided using a sensor mounted to the patient's finger to measure the tremor values. Then, a controller sends the appropriate control commands to the actuator, and finally, the BG areas of the brain actuator are simulated by the actuator. In the present paper, to control Parkinson's tremor and reduce the value of stimulation intensity efficiently, two areas of BG such as subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internal (GPi) were controlled simultaneously. This strategy provides a reduction in the applied field and side-effects (e.g. muscle contraction and speech disorder) resulting from stimulation intensity. In particular, a new model-free scheme, called intelligent single input interval type-2 fuzzy logic (iSIT2-FL) combined with non-integer sliding mode control (SMC), is proposed to control two areas of BG. In the suggested strategy, an extended state observer (ESO) is established to approximate the unknown BG dynamics, whereas the non-integer SMC is applied to remove the ESO estimation error. Comparative simulation explorations are performed subsequently to ascertain the superior performance of the suggested intelligent control scheme over that of the state-of-the-art approaches.",,,Rehabilitation,Tremor,Deep Brain Stimulation,,,,jsen.2019.2949862,IEEE Journals,

A novel soft joint structure based on composite fabric material is introduced for the design of the soft glove with bionic method, and experiments are conducted to verify the effeteness of the proposed soft rehabilitation glove. The test results showed that when the fluid pressure was 0.42 MPa, the joint angle of MCP, PIP and DIP could be up to 81Ã‚Â°, 98Ã‚Â°, 72Ã‚Â°, and produce output torque of 1.18Nm, 1.44Nm and 1.82Nm respectively, which meets the requirements of the hand rehabilitation. A dynamic rehabilitation-training test of the rehabilitation glove was also carried out, and the results showed that the movement frequency of soft fingers could reach 30 times/min, which is sufficient for repetitive flexion/extension exercise. In order to verify the grasping characteristics of the soft glove for irregular objects, experiments were carried out.

In the large majority of studies, the effect of RAS has been assessed during common activities such as walking and turning. However, how RAS modulates parkinsonian behaviors in more challenging settings of daily living and whether a machine learning algorithm could classify them remains unclear. Eleven patients with idiopathic PD (age 72Ã‚Â±7 years) were asked to walk under four conditions: straight walking, walking over an irregular surface, walking within a narrow pathway, and walking along a curving path (eight-shaped), with and without external stimulation. RAS pace was set at 110% of the normal cadence and spatio-temporal gait parameters were measured through two inertial measurement units placed on feet. k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm, with and without principal component analysis (PCA) as feature selector, was used for the classification of walking conditions. Cadence, gait speed, and gait time improved during RAS walking, regardless of challenging walking conditions. On the contrary, stride length increased only in straight walking, while gait speed showed improvement also in walking over an irregular surface and walking within narrow pathway conditions. k-NN algorithm reported higher accuracy (72.4%) in the classification of eight- shaped curving path both considering the overall feature set and a reduced one.

Wearable tremor suppression devices (WTSD) provide an alternative approach, however, tremor in the fingers has not been given as much attention as tremor in the elbow and the wrist. Therefore, the objective of this study is to design a wearable tremor suppression glove that can suppress tremor simultaneously, but independently, in multiple hand joints without restricting the user's voluntary motion. Methods: A WTSD was designed for managing tremor in the index finger metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, thumb MCP joint, and the wrist. The prototype was tested and assessed on a participant living with parkinsonian tremor. Results: The experimental evaluation showed an overall suppression of 73.1%, 80.7%, and 85.5% in resting tremor, 70.2%, 79.5%, and 81% in postural tremor, and 60.0%, 58.7%, and 65.0% in kinetic tremor in the index finger MCP joint, the thumb MCP joint, and the wrist, respectively. Conclusion: This first assessment of a WTSD for people living with Parkinson's disease provides confirmation of the feasibility of the approach. The next step requires a comprehensive validation on a broader population in order to evaluate the performance of the WTSD.

Besides tremor amplitude, its frequency is also evaluated over time, thus providing the means to distinguish between, e.g., rest and action tremor. No analytical model is assumed for the tremor signal form. The characterization of tremor severity is performed by the steady-state analysis of a Markov chain, whose states correspond to different intervals of tremor amplitude.

Several researches have reported the use of haptic stimulation to increase the dynamic stability of gait. Haptic systems have many advantages such as, portability and low-cost, that make them extremely suited for rehabilitation applications. However, until now the use of these systems has been focused mainly on the lower limbs. Gait is a harmonic motion that includes both the upper and lower limbs.

The subject's CoM position is estimated by the proposed CoM estimation model and the Center of Pressure (CoP) position is measured by a Wii balance board. The CoP-CoM trajectory during the GI task is used to assess and quantify the patient's dynamic balance control. Using data collected from both healthy subjects and patients with Parkinson's Disease, the proposed balance evaluation model is able to quantify the subject's balance level which is consistent with the human PT's assessments in traditional balance evaluation tests.

In this paper, we analyzed the influence of avatar appearance, environment awareness, and camera perspective on gait parameters relevant for clinical application. Four different avatar appearances, varying in abstraction, two environmental settings, as well as an egocentric and exocentric camera perspective were compared in three walking tasks on a treadmill. Our results show that variability, as an indicator for gait stability, is significantly impacted by VR exposure in comparison to a real world (in vivo) baseline. Further, our results revealed that walking tasks influence gait behavior significantly different in VR compared to in vivo. Overall, these findings suggest that particular care has to be taken when assessing gait characteristics acquired from subjects immersed in VR and that equivalence of results with in vivo may not be blindly assumed.",,,Rehabilitation,Gait,Video Recording,,,,vr50410.2021.00055,IEEE Conferences,

We propose a system capable of both FOG prediction and detection using signals from tri-axial accelerometer sensors that will be useful in initializing RAS with minimal latency. We compared the performance of several time frequency analysis techniques, including moving windows extracted from the signals, handcrafted features, Recurrence Plots (RP), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Discreet Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Pseudo Wigner Ville Distribution (PWVD) with Deep Learning (DL) based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We also propose three Ensemble Network Architectures that combine all the time frequency representations and DL architectures. Experimental results show that our ensemble architectures significantly improve the performance compared with existing techniques. We also present the results of applying our method trained on a publicly available dataset to data collected from patients using wearable sensors in collaboration with A.T.

Effect of External Feedback on Bimanual Coordination Control in Patients with Parkinson's Disease,"Kim, Eonho; Im, Chang-Ha; Song, Yong-Gwan",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,bimanual coordination; Parkinson's disease; basal ganglia; Bradykinesia and Dyskinesias; information processing,"Bimanual coordination control requires task-specific control of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the coupling of both upper limbs. The present study examined the effects of external feedback (i.e., auditory signal) on bimanual coordination movement during patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Twelve PD patients in advanced stages and 12 early stages of untreated PD patients, and 12 age-matched normal adults were instructed to perform bimanual coordination control using preference (1 Hz) and fast (1.75 Hz) speeds with metronome auditory cue. The results demonstrated that the advanced PD patients showed reduced synchronized bimanual coordination control during the anti-phase movement compared with other two groups. Moreover, the decreased movement accuracy was exhibited not only at the preference speed, but also more particularly at the fast speed with anti-phase rather than in-phase movement. This suggests that PD results in impairments in scaling the bimanual movement speed and amplitude of limb, and these deficits were more pronounced as a function of movement control speed. Overall, the current data provide evidence of the pathophysiology of the basal ganglia on the bimanual coordination movement.",,,Rehabilitation,"Limb movements,

Developing an Assisting Device to Reduce the Vibration on the Hands of Elders,"Phan Van, Hieu; Ngo, Ha",2021,Applied Sciences,assisted robot; vibration suppression; wearable device; uniaxial tremor; motion control; mechanical design,"In our society, elderly people are one of the most vulnerable classes. At present, aging in the population is becoming a more and more serious issue. This might lead to several diseases related to aging such as Parkinson's disease. From the viewpoint of assistive techniques, a device for disadvantaged groups should be created to lessen some of the inconveniences in their lives. Therefore, in this paper, a wearable mechanism to suppress axial vibration is proposed for people who suffer from unexpected tremors in their daily lives. Some investigations on Parkinson's patients were carried out to infer their characteristics. A dynamic model of the gyroscopic system was then analyzed to formulate interactive torques in the working space. The control input was quantified concerning balancing the system state from the kinetic energy and using the feedback linearization technique. The framework of the proposed device was then described via mechanical analysis and prototype design. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, the system's mathematical dynamics were simulated in a MATLAB environment. In a frequency range of 2-6 Hz, the system response adapted well to axial tremors. Our hardware in the proposed design was tested in different test scenarios such as in non-gyro- and gyro-based tremor suppression for real-world applications. Hand tremors were measured using wearable equipment with various levels of amplitude. From these results, it is clear that our method could have an effectiveness of up to 92.6%, which is considerably better than that in the non-gyro case. Hence, this innovative mechanism is expected to be employed in the fields of medical assistance, health care services, and robotics.",,,Rehabilitation,Tremor,Wearable,,,,app11115026,Article,
Sensor Network for Analyzing Upper Body Strategies in Parkinson's Disease versus Normative Kinematic Patterns,"Romano, Paola; Pournajaf, Sanaz; Ottaviani, Marco; Gison, Annalisa; Infarinato, Francesco; Mantoni, Claudia; De Pandis, Maria; Franceschini, Marco; Goffredo, Michela",2021,Sensors,upper limb; Parkinson's disease; Box and Block test; inertial sensors network; biomechanics analysis; kinematic data; hand trajectories,"In rehabilitation, the upper limb function is generally assessed using clinical scales and functional motor tests. Although the Box and Block Test (BBT) is commonly used for its simplicity and ease of execution, it does not provide a quantitative measure of movement quality. This study proposes the integration of an ecological Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) system for analysis of the upper body kinematics during the execution of a targeted version of BBT, by able-bodied persons with subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Joint angle parameters (mean angle and range of execution) and hand trajectory kinematic indices (mean velocity, mean acceleration, and dimensionless jerk) were calculated from the data acquired by a network of seven IMUs. The sensors were applied on the trunk, head, and upper limb in order to characterize the motor strategy used during the execution of BBT. Statistics revealed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between the two groups, showing compensatory strategies in subjects with PD. The proposed IMU-based targeted BBT protocol allows to assess the upper limb function during manual dexterity tasks and could be used in the future for assessing the efficacy of rehabilitative treatments.",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Wearable,,,,s21113823,Article,
Baduanjin Qigong Intervention by Telerehabilitation (TeleParkinson): A Proof-of-Concept Study in Parkinson's Disease,"Carvalho, Livia; DÃƒÂ©cary, Simon; Beaulieu-Boire, Isabelle; Dostie, Rosalie; Lalonde, Isabelle; Texier, Ãƒâ€°milie; Laprise, Laurence; Pepin, Elizabeth; Gilbert, MÃƒÂ©lodie; Corriveau, HÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ne; Tousignant, Michel",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,physical therapy; exercise; rehabilitation; parkinsonism; telemedicine,"Many people living with Parkinson's Disease (PD) face issues with healthcare services, including delays in diagnosis and treatment, as well as limited access to specialized care, including rehabilitation programs. Non-motor and motor signs and symptoms typically observed in people with PD, such as tremor, rigidity, postural instability, bradykinesia, and freezing are particularly disabling and have been associated with falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and a worse quality of life. Baduanjin Qigong (BDJ) programs have been proven potentially effective in improving physical outcomes and reducing the incidence of falls in PD. The aim of this case report, proof-of-concept, study was to explore the adherence, feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a BDJ program offered via telerehabilitation in people with PD living in the community. Two participants performed semi-supervised exercise sessions at home, twice a week (over eight weeks) using the TeraPlus platform. Adherence, adverse events, and feasibility (technical implementability), acceptability (patient satisfaction), patient-reported, self-reported, and performance outcomes were measured. Results were based on single-subject descriptive data, minimal detectable change, and anchor-based minimally important difference. Our findings suggest that the intervention seems feasible with no major technical issues or adverse events, and high adherence; acceptable (patient satisfaction); and potentially effective to improve markers of walking performance (gait speed, balance), and quality of life (activities of daily living, mobility).",,,Rehabilitation,"Posture,

Can Immersive Virtual Reality Videogames Help Parkinson's Disease Patients? A Case Study,"Campo-Prieto, Pablo; RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Fuentes, Gustavo; Cancela-Carral, JosÃƒÂ©",2021,Sensors,virtual reality exposure therapy; Parkinson's disease; older adults; video games; exergaming; neurological rehabilitation; games for health,"Video games have proven useful in physical rehabilitation therapy. Accessibility, however, is limited for some groups such as the elderly or patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We explore the potential of fully immersive video games as a rehabilitation tool in PD patients. Four patients with mild-moderate PD (3 males:1 female, 53-71 years) participated in the study. Training consisted in two immersive virtual reality video gaming sessions. Outcomes were evaluated using System Usability Scale (SUS), Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), Game Experience Questionnaire-post game (GEQ), an ad hoc satisfaction questionnaire and perceived effort. All participants completed the sessions without adverse effects (100%), without SSQ symptoms reported. Post-gaming SUS was &gt;75% in both sessions (range 75-80%). Post-gaming GEQ scores were 3.3-4.0/4 in both sessions. Immersive virtual reality video gaming is feasible in patients with mild-moderate PD, with positive usability and patient satisfaction, and no adverse effects.",,,Rehabilitation,,Video Recording,,,,s21144825,Brief Report,
Blood-Brain Barrier and Neurodegenerative Diseases-Modeling with iPSC-Derived Brain Cells,"Wu, Ying-Chieh; Sonninen, Tuuli-Maria; Peltonen, Sanni; Koistinaho, Jari; Lehtonen, Ã…Â ÃƒÂ¡rka",2021,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC); blood-brain barrier (BBB); neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs),"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulates the delivery of oxygen and important nutrients to the brain through active and passive transport and prevents neurotoxins from entering the brain. It also has a clearance function and removes carbon dioxide and toxic metabolites from the central nervous system (CNS). Several drugs are unable to cross the BBB and enter the CNS, adding complexity to drug screens targeting brain disorders. A well-functioning BBB is essential for maintaining healthy brain tissue, and a malfunction of the BBB, linked to its permeability, results in toxins and immune cells entering the CNS. This impairment is associated with a variety of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the BBB in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we focus on recent progress of using human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived models to study the BBB. We review the potential of novel stem cell-based platforms in modeling the BBB and address advances and key challenges of using stem cell technology in modeling the human BBB. Finally, we highlight future directions in this area.",,,Rehabilitation,,,,,,ijms22147710,Review,
(Dys)Prosody in Parkinson's Disease: Effects of Medication and Disease Duration on Intonation and Prosodic Phrasing,"Frota, SÃƒÂ³nia; Cruz, Marisa; Cardoso, Rita; GuimarÃƒÂ£es, Isabel; Ferreira, Joaquim; Pinto, Serge; VigÃƒÂ¡rio, Marina",2021,Brain Sciences,prosody; Parkinson's disease; intonation; prosodic phrasing; prosodic phonology; intonational phonology; autosegmental-metrical (AM) approach; speech production; levodopa; disease duration,"The phonology of prosody has received little attention in studies of motor speech disorders. The present study investigates the phonology of intonation (nuclear contours) and speech chunking (prosodic phrasing) in Parkinson's disease (PD) as a function of medication intake and duration of the disease. Following methods of the prosodic and intonational phonology frameworks, we examined the ability of 30 PD patients to use intonation categories and prosodic phrasing structures in ways similar to 20 healthy controls to convey similar meanings. Speech data from PD patients were collected before and after a dopaminomimetic drug intake and were phonologically analyzed in relation to nuclear contours and intonational phrasing. Besides medication, disease duration and the presence of motor fluctuations were also factors included in the analyses. Overall, PD patients showed a decreased ability to use nuclear contours and prosodic phrasing. Medication improved intonation regardless of disease duration but did not help with dysprosodic phrasing. In turn, disease duration and motor fluctuations affected phrasing patterns but had no impact on intonation. Our study demonstrated that the phonology of prosody is impaired in PD, and prosodic categories and structures may be differently affected, with implications for the understanding of PD neurophysiology and therapy.",,,Rehabilitation,Speech topics,Audio Recording,,,,brainsci11081100,Article,
Validity of a Fully-Immersive VR-Based Version of the Box and Blocks Test for Upper Limb Function Assessment in Parkinson's Disease,"OÃƒÂ±a, Edwin; JardÃƒÂ³n, Alberto; Cuesta-GÃƒÂ³mez, Alicia; SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Herrera-Baeza, Patricia; Cano-de-la-Cuerda, Roberto; Balaguer, Carlos",2020,Sensors,automatic; assessment; manual dexterity; Parkinson's disease; neurological rehabilitation; virtual reality; games for health,"In recent decades, gaming technology has been accepted as a feasible method for complementing traditional clinical practice, especially in neurorehabilitation; however, the viability of using 3D Virtual Reality (VR) for the assessment of upper limb motor function has not been fully explored. For that purpose, we developed a VR-based version of the Box and Blocks Test (BBT), a clinical test for the assessment of manual dexterity, as an automated alternative to the classical procedure. Our VR-based BBT (VR-BBT) integrates the traditional BBT mechanics into gameplay using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) to capture the user&rsquo;s hand motion and the Oculus Rift headset to provide a fully immersive experience. This paper focuses on evaluating the validity of our VR-BBT to reliably measure the manual dexterity in a sample of patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD). For this study, a group of twenty individuals in a mild to moderate stage of PD were recruited. Participants were asked to perform the physical BBT (once) and our proposed VR-BBT (twice) system, separately. Correlation analysis of collected data was carried out. Statistical analysis proved that the performance data collected by the VR-BBT significantly correlated with the conventional assessment of the BBT. The VR-BBT scores have shown a significant association with PD severity measured by the Hoehn and Yahr scale. This fact suggests that the VR-BBT could be used as a reliable indicator for health improvements in patients with PD. Finally, the VR-BBT system presented high usability and acceptability rated by clinicians and patients.",,,Rehabilitation,Limb movements,Video Recording,,,,s20102773,Article,
Muscle Synergies in Parkinson's Disease,"Mileti, Ilaria; Zampogna, Alessandro; Santuz, Alessandro; Asci, Francesco; Del Prete, Zaccaria; Arampatzis, Adamantios; Palermo, Eduardo; Suppa, Antonio",2020,Sensors,Parkinson's disease; muscle synergies; motor modules; motor primitives; electromyography; balance; locomotion; gait,"Over the last two decades, experimental studies in humans and other vertebrates have increasingly used muscle synergy analysis as a computational tool to examine the physiological basis of motor control. The theoretical background of muscle synergies is based on the potential ability of the motor system to coordinate muscles groups as a single unit, thus reducing high-dimensional data to low-dimensional elements. Muscle synergy analysis may represent a new framework to examine the pathophysiological basis of specific motor symptoms in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), including balance and gait disorders that are often unresponsive to treatment. The precise mechanisms contributing to these motor symptoms in PD remain largely unknown. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of balance and gait disorders in PD is necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies. This narrative review discusses muscle synergies in the evaluation of motor symptoms in PD. We first discuss the theoretical background and computational methods for muscle synergy extraction from physiological data. We then critically examine studies assessing muscle synergies in PD during different motor tasks including balance, gait and upper limb movements. Finally, we speculate about the prospects and challenges of muscle synergy analysis in order to promote future research protocols in PD.",,,Rehabilitation,"Posture,
